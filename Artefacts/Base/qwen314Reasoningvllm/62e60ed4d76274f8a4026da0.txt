Okay, I need to generate Python code for the given function signature and docstring. The function is called keys and is supposed to return the __keys property of a class as a List. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function is a method of a class, since it has 'self' as the first parameter. The docstring says it returns the __keys property. So, the class probably has an attribute named __keys, and this method is just returning it as a list.

Wait, but in Python, if you have a property, you might use a getter method. However, the function here is named keys, which suggests it's a method that accesses the __keys attribute. So maybe the __keys is a private variable, and the keys method returns it as a list.

So the code would be something like:

def keys(self):
    """
    Returns the __keys property of a class as a List
    """
    return list(self.__keys)

But wait, the __keys could be a list already. However, the method is returning it as a List, maybe to ensure it's a list even if __keys is another iterable. Or perhaps the __keys is a set or some other collection. Converting it to a list would make sense here.

Alternatively, if __keys is a list, then returning it directly would be okay, but the docstring says "as a List", which might imply that it's converting it to a list. But maybe the original __keys is a list, and the method just returns it. However, since the user specified to return it as a List, perhaps they want to make sure it's a list, even if it's another type. So using list() to convert it would be safe.

But I need to check if the __keys attribute exists. However, the problem statement doesn't mention handling exceptions, so maybe it's assumed that the attribute is present.

So the code is straightforward. The method returns the __keys attribute as a list. So the implementation would be simply returning self.__keys, but maybe converting it to a list if it's not already. However, if __keys is already a list, then just returning it. But the docstring says "Returns the __keys property of a class as a List", which might mean that regardless of the original type, it's returned as a list. So perhaps the code is:

return list(self.__keys)

But I need to make sure that the __keys is a property. Wait, in Python, properties are usually accessed via @property decorators. But the function here is named keys, which could be the getter for the __keys property. However, the user's docstring says "Returns the __keys property of a class as a List", so maybe the __keys is a list, and the keys method returns it. But why have a method if it's just returning the attribute? Maybe the __keys is a private variable, and the keys method is a public way to access it as a list.

Alternatively, maybe the __keys is a property that's managed by a getter. But the user hasn't provided any other code, so perhaps the simplest solution is to return the __keys attribute as a list. So the code would be:

def keys(self):
    """
    Returns the __keys property of a class as a List
    """
    return self.__keys

But wait, if __keys is a list, then returning it directly is fine. However, if it's another type, like a set, converting to a list would be necessary. The problem statement says "as a List", so maybe the method is supposed to return a list representation. But without more context, it's hard to tell. The user might just want the method to return the __keys attribute, assuming it's already a list.

Another possibility is that the __keys is a dictionary's keys, but the function is returning them as a list. However, the docstring says "the __keys property of a class", not a dictionary. So maybe the class has a __keys attribute which is a list or similar.

In the absence of more information, the most straightforward implementation is to return self.__keys. However, perhaps the user expects that the __keys is a property that's accessed via a getter. But since the function is named keys, and the property is __keys, maybe the method is just exposing that attribute.

Wait, but in Python, if you have a property, you'd typically have a method with the same name as the property. For example, if there's a @property decorator for keys, then the method would be the getter. But the user's code shows a method named keys that returns the __keys property. So maybe the __keys is a list, and the keys method returns it. So the code is as simple as returning self.__keys.

But the user's docstring says "Returns the __keys property of a class as a List". So maybe the __keys is not a list, but the method converts it into one. For example, if __keys is a set, then converting to a list. But again, without knowing the type of __keys, it's hard to say. However, the function's return type is specified as a List, so the code should ensure that.

But the user hasn't provided any other details. So perhaps the correct approach is to return self.__keys as a list. So the code would be:

def keys(self):
    """
    Returns the __keys property of a class as a List
    """
    return list(self.__keys)

But maybe the __keys is already a list, and the method just returns it. However, the user might have intended that the __keys is a property that's accessed via a getter. But since the function is named keys, and the property is __keys, perhaps it's just returning the attribute.

Alternatively, if the class uses a property, maybe the code is:

@property
def keys(self):
    """
    Returns the __keys property of a class as a List
    """
    return self.__keys

But the original function signature is def keys(self):, which is a regular method, not a property. So the user might have intended that the method returns the __keys attribute. So the code would be as simple as returning self.__keys. However, the docstring says "as a List", so perhaps the __keys is a list, and the method returns it directly.

But why would the method be named keys if the attribute is __keys? Maybe it's a standard method, like in a dictionary, where keys() returns a view, but here it's returning the list.

In any case, given the information, the most straightforward code is:

def keys(self):
    """
    Returns the __keys property of a class as a List
    """
    return self.__keys

But I need to make sure that the __keys is a list. If not, maybe converting it. However, without knowing the type, perhaps the user just wants to return the attribute as is, and the docstring mentions that it's a List. So the code is as above.

Another thing: the user might have intended that the __keys is a property that's being accessed. But in Python, if you have a property, you'd have a method with the same name. However, the function here is named keys, and the property is __keys. So maybe the method is just returning the __keys attribute.

So the final code is:

def keys(self):
    """
    Returns the __keys property of a class as a List
    """
    return self.__keys

But I should check if there's any other possible way. For example, if the __keys is a list, then returning it as a list is correct. If it's another type, maybe the user wants to convert it. However, the problem statement doesn't mention that. So I think the correct code is just returning the __keys attribute.
