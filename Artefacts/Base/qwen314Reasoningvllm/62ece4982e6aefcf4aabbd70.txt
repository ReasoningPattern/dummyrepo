Okay, I need to write a Python function called os_is_mac that checks if the operating system is macOS. Let me think about how to do this.

First, I remember that Python has the os module which can be used to get the operating system name. The os.name attribute returns a string indicating the operating system. But wait, on macOS, does os.name return 'posix'? Because I think on Unix-like systems, including macOS, it returns 'posix', while on Windows it's 'nt'. So maybe checking os.name == 'posix' would indicate macOS, but wait, that's not specific enough. Because Linux and other Unix systems would also return 'posix'. So that's not reliable.

Hmm, right. The platform module might be more accurate. The platform.system() function returns the system name, like 'Darwin' for macOS. Oh right! Because macOS is based on Darwin, so checking if platform.system() equals 'Darwin' would be the correct approach.

So the steps are: import the platform module, then call platform.system() and check if it's 'Darwin'. Return True if yes, else False.

Wait, but sometimes the system name might be case-sensitive? Let me check. The platform.system() returns 'Darwin' with a capital D, so the comparison should be exact.

So the code would be:

import platform

def os_is_mac():
    return platform.system() == 'Darwin'

But wait, what about other possible variations? Like, are there any other possible values that could be returned on macOS? I don't think so. The system() function should return 'Darwin' for macOS. So this should work.

Alternatively, maybe using the os module's uname? Like, os.uname().sysname. But on Windows, that's not available. However, since the function is supposed to return False otherwise, maybe using platform is better because it's more cross-platform.

Yes, platform.system() is the right way. So the code is straightforward. Just compare the system name to 'Darwin'.
