Okay, I need to write a Python function called parse_frequency that takes a frequency string and returns a datetime.timedelta instance. Let's see the requirements. The function should return None if the frequency is None or "always". Otherwise, it should parse the string into a number and a time unit, then create a timedelta with that unit and number. But if the string can't be parsed, it should raise a ValueError.

First, I'll check if the input is None or "always". If so, return None. Then, split the frequency string into parts. The string should be in the format "number timeunit", like "3 days" or "5 hours". So splitting by whitespace would give me two parts: the number and the unit.

Wait, but what if there's more than one space? Like "  2   weeks"? Probably, splitting on whitespace and stripping would handle that. So I'll split the string into tokens, maybe using split() which splits on any whitespace and ignores leading/trailing.

Once split, I need to check that there are exactly two parts. If not, raise ValueError. Then, the first part should be a number. So I'll try converting it to an integer. If that fails, like if it's a non-numeric string, then raise ValueError.

The second part is the time unit. The allowed units are those that datetime.timedelta accepts. Let's think: timedelta has parameters like days, seconds, microseconds, minutes, hours, weeks. So the unit part should be one of these, but in the string, maybe lowercase? Like "day", "days", "hour", "hours", etc. But the function's example shows "timeunit" as a placeholder, but the actual allowed units are the ones that timedelta can take. Wait, the example says "3 timeunit" returns timedelta(timeunit=3). But that's not correct because timedelta doesn't have a 'timeunit' parameter. Oh, maybe the example is illustrative. The actual parameters are days, seconds, etc. So the function needs to map the unit string to the corresponding parameter name.

So, for example, if the input is "3 days", then return timedelta(days=3). Similarly, "5 hours" would be timedelta(hours=5). But what about plural vs singular? Like "day" vs "days"? The example uses "timeunit" which is plural, but maybe the function should accept both singular and plural forms. Hmm, the problem statement says "unit of time", so perhaps the unit can be either singular or plural. But the function's example uses "timeunit" as a placeholder, but in reality, the allowed units are the ones that timedelta can take. Wait, the example might be a mistake. Let me check the actual parameters of timedelta. The parameters are days, seconds, microseconds, minutes, hours, weeks. So the unit part should be one of these, but the user might input "day" instead of "days". How to handle that?

The problem says that given "3 timeunit", return timedelta(timeunit=3). But that's not a valid parameter. So maybe the example is incorrect, and the actual intended units are the ones that timedelta accepts. So perhaps the function should map the unit string to the correct parameter name. For example, if the unit is "day", then use days=3. Similarly for "hour" to hours, etc.

So I need a mapping from possible unit strings to the corresponding parameter names. Let's create a dictionary that maps both singular and plural forms to the correct parameter. Like:

unit_map = {
    'day': 'days',
    'days': 'days',
    'hour': 'hours',
    'hours': 'hours',
    'minute': 'minutes',
    'minutes': 'minutes',
    'second': 'seconds',
    'seconds': 'seconds',
    'week': 'weeks',
    'weeks': 'weeks',
    'microsecond': 'microseconds',
    'microseconds': 'microseconds'
}

Wait, but the user might input other forms, like "hr" or "hrs"? The problem statement says "unit of time", but it's not clear if it's limited to the standard ones. The docstring example uses "timeunit" but that's probably a placeholder. The function's example says that "3 timeunit" returns timedelta(timeunit=3), but that's not valid. So maybe the intended units are the ones that timedelta accepts, but the user can input any of their singular or plural forms. So I need to check if the unit part is in the allowed list.

So the steps would be:

1. Check if frequency is None or "always", return None.
2. Split the frequency into parts. If not exactly two parts, raise ValueError.
3. Check if the first part is a valid number. If not, raise ValueError.
4. Check if the second part is a valid time unit (like days, hours, etc. in singular or plural).
5. Map the unit to the correct parameter name.
6. Create a timedelta with that parameter and the number.

But how to handle the mapping? Let's think about the possible units. The allowed units for timedelta are days, seconds, microseconds, minutes, hours, weeks. So the user's input unit should be one of these, possibly in singular or plural form.

So for example, if the unit is "day", map to 'days'; if "days", same. Similarly for "hour" to "hours", etc.

So the unit_map would be:

unit_map = {
    'day': 'days',
    'days': 'days',
    'hour': 'hours',
    'hours': 'hours',
    'minute': 'minutes',
    'minutes': 'minutes',
    'second': 'seconds',
    'seconds': 'seconds',
    'week': 'weeks',
    'weeks': 'weeks',
    'microsecond': 'microseconds',
    'microseconds': 'microseconds'
}

Then, check if the second part is in the keys of unit_map. If not, raise ValueError.

Once the parameter name is determined, create the timedelta with that parameter and the number.

But wait, the function is supposed to return a datetime.timedelta instance. So the code would be:

import datetime

def parse_frequency(frequency):
    if frequency is None or frequency.lower() == 'always':
        return None
    parts = frequency.split()
    if len(parts) != 2:
        raise ValueError("Invalid frequency format")
    try:
        num = int(parts[0])
    except ValueError:
        raise ValueError("Number part is not valid")
    unit = parts[1].lower()
    if unit not in unit_map:
        raise ValueError("Unknown time unit")
    param = unit_map[unit]
    return datetime.timedelta(**{param: num})

Wait, but the unit_map needs to be defined. So I need to include that in the code.

But what about cases where the unit is not in the map? Like "month" or "year"? The problem says to raise ValueError in that case.

So the code would have that unit_map, then check if the unit is in it.

Another thing: the split() method splits on any whitespace, so if the frequency is "3   days", it would split into ["3", "days"], which is correct.

Testing some examples:

parse_frequency("3 days") should return timedelta(days=3)
parse_frequency("5 hours") returns timedelta(hours=5)
parse_frequency("1 week") returns timedelta(weeks=1)
parse_frequency("2") would split into ["2"], len(parts) is 1, so ValueError.

What about if the number is zero? Well, the code allows it, but the problem says nothing about that, so probably acceptable.

But what if the number is a float? The example uses "3 timeunit", which is an integer. The problem says "number", but in Python, numbers can be integers or floats. However, the function's example uses an integer. The current code uses int(parts[0]), which would fail for floats. But the problem says "number", so maybe it should accept both. However, the function's return example uses an integer. Let me check the original problem again.

The docstring says, for instance, given "3 timeunit", return datetime.timedelta(timeunit=3). But the actual timedelta parameters are days, etc. So perhaps the user intended that the unit is one of the allowed ones, and the number is an integer. But the problem says "number", which could be a float. However, the example uses an integer. The current code uses int, which would not handle floats. But maybe the function is supposed to accept numbers as integers. Alternatively, maybe it should parse to a float. Let me think: the function's return example uses 3 as an integer. But timedelta can take integers or floats for the parameters. For example, timedelta(days=3.5) is valid.

But the problem says "number", which could be a float. However, the original example uses an integer. The user might have intended that the number is an integer. However, the problem says to raise ValueError if the frequency can't be parsed. So if the first part is not a number, it's invalid. But if it's a float, like "3.5 days", then converting to int would fail, but maybe the function should accept that. However, the example uses an integer. The problem statement isn't clear. Let me check the original function's example again.

The example says: given "3 timeunit", return timedelta(timeunit=3). But that's not a valid parameter. So maybe the example is wrong. The actual parameters are days, hours, etc. So perhaps the function is supposed to accept units like days, hours, etc., and the number can be an integer or a float. But the current code uses int(parts[0]), which would not handle floats. However, the problem says "number", which could be a float. So maybe I should use float instead of int. But the example uses 3, which is an integer. But perhaps the function is supposed to accept any numeric value.

Wait, the problem says "number and a unit of time". So the number can be any numeric value, like 2.5. So the code should parse the first part as a float. But then, the timedelta parameters can take floats. For example, timedelta(days=2.5) is allowed.

So changing the code to use float(parts[0]) instead of int. But then, what if the user inputs something like "3.5 days"? That would be valid. However, the original example uses an integer. But the problem says "number", which can be a float. So I should use float.

But then, the function's return example may have been incorrect. However, the user's example is just illustrative. So the code should handle numbers as floats.

So modifying the code:

try:
    num = float(parts[0])
except ValueError:
    raise ValueError("Invalid number format")

But then, the function returns a timedelta. However, the parameters of timedelta are all integers. Wait, no: the parameters can be floats. For example, timedelta(days=3.5) is a valid object. So that's okay.

But the problem says "return a corresponding datetime.timedelta instance". So the code should create that.

So the code would be:

import datetime

def parse_frequency(frequency):
    if frequency is None or frequency.lower() == 'always':
        return None
    parts = frequency.split()
    if len(parts) != 2:
        raise ValueError("Invalid frequency format")
    try:
        num = float(parts[0])
    except ValueError:
        raise ValueError("Number part is not valid")
    unit = parts[1].lower()
    unit_map = {
        'day': 'days',
        'days': 'days',
        'hour': 'hours',
        'hours': 'hours',
        'minute': 'minutes',
        'minutes': 'minutes',
        'second': 'seconds',
        'seconds': 'seconds',
        'week': 'weeks',
        'weeks': 'weeks',
        'microsecond': 'microseconds',
        'microseconds': 'microseconds'
    }
    if unit not in unit_map:
        raise ValueError("Unknown time unit")
    param = unit_map[unit]
    return datetime.timedelta(**{param: num})

Wait, but what about if the unit is something like "d" or "h"? The problem says "unit of time", but the example uses full names. So perhaps the function expects the full names. The user's example uses "timeunit" as a placeholder, but the actual allowed units are the ones that timedelta uses. So the code should check for the full names, like days, hours, etc.

But the problem says, "unit of time", but it's not specified. So maybe the function should accept any of the possible units that timedelta can take, in singular or plural. So the code as above would handle that.

Testing for "3 days" would work. "5 hours" would work. "1 week" would work. What if the unit is "minutes"? Then param is 'minutes', and the code returns timedelta(minutes=5).

But what about if the unit is "m" or "min"? The problem doesn't mention that, so perhaps the function is supposed to accept only the full names. The user's example uses "timeunit" which is probably a placeholder. So the code should check for the exact unit names as per the timedelta parameters, in singular or plural.

So the unit_map is correct as above.

Another edge case: if the frequency is "always", return None. Also, if it's None, return None.

But in the code, the check is if frequency is None or frequency.lower() == 'always'. So even if the frequency is "Always" or "ALWAYS", it would be converted to lowercase and checked.

So that's handled.

Now, what about if the number is zero? Well, that's allowed. The code would create a timedelta with zero days, etc. But the problem says nothing about that, so it's okay.

Now, possible errors: if the frequency is "3 day", then unit is 'day', which is in the unit_map, so it would use 'days' as the parameter. So that's okay.

But what if the unit is "month"? Then, it's not in the unit_map, and raises ValueError.

So the code should handle that.

Now, the function's return type is supposed to be a datetime.timedelta instance. The code returns that correctly.

So putting it all together.

But wait, the function's docstring says the return is a str, but that's probably a mistake. The user probably meant to return a datetime.timedelta. Because the example says return datetime.timedelta(...). So the docstring's @return says str, which is incorrect. But the user's instruction says to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring. However, the function's return is supposed to be a timedelta, not a str. So the docstring's @return is wrong, but the code should follow the function's intended behavior, not the docstring's error. So the code should return a timedelta instance.

But the user's docstring says @return str, the corresponding datetime. That's probably a mistake. But since the user provided the docstring, maybe they made an error. However, the function's example shows returning a timedelta instance. So the correct return type is datetime.timedelta, not str. So the docstring's @return is incorrect. But since the user provided that, perhaps it's a typo and the actual return is a timedelta. So the code should return a timedelta.

Therefore, the code should proceed as outlined.

Another thing: the function's parameters. The function is given a frequency string "number timeunit". So the code splits into two parts. If there's more than one space, like "  2   days", split() would still give ["2", "days"], which is correct.

So the code seems to handle that.

Now, implement that in Python.

Wait, but the code is supposed to be in Python, and the user says to output only the code in python markdown format. Also, the code needs to import datetime.

So the code would be:

import datetime

def parse_frequency(frequency):
    """
    Given a frequency string with a number and a unit of time, return a corresponding
    datetime.timedelta instance.
    If the frequency is None or "always", return None.
    Raise ValueError if the given frequency cannot be parsed.
    For instance, given "3 timeunit", return datetime.timedelta(timeunit=3)

    @param frequency :  A frequency string "number timeunit"

    @return str, the corresponding datetime
    """
    if frequency is None or frequency.lower() == 'always':
        return None
    parts = frequency.split()
    if len(parts) != 2:
        raise ValueError("Invalid frequency format")
    try:
        num = float(parts[0])
    except ValueError:
        raise ValueError("Number part is not valid")
    unit = parts[1].lower()
    unit_map = {
        'day': 'days',
        'days': 'days',
        'hour': 'hours',
        'hours': 'hours',
        'minute': 'minutes',
        'minutes': 'minutes',
        'second': 'seconds',
        'seconds': 'seconds',
        'week': 'weeks',
        'weeks': 'weeks',
        'microsecond': 'microseconds',
        'microseconds': 'microseconds'
    }
    if unit not in unit_map:
        raise ValueError("Unknown time unit")
    param = unit_map[unit]
    return datetime.timedelta(**{param: num})

But the docstring says @return str, but the code returns a datetime.timedelta. That's a discrepancy. However, the user's example shows returning a timedelta. So perhaps the docstring's return type is a mistake. The code should return a timedelta, not a string. So the user probably made an error in the docstring. But since the code is generated based on the given docstring, maybe I should follow the function's intended return type. However, the example in the docstring says to return a timedelta instance, so the return type is datetime.timedelta. Therefore, the code is correct, and the docstring's @return is a mistake. But the user hasn't mentioned that, so I proceed with the code as per the example.

Another thing: the example says "3 timeunit" returns timedelta(timeunit=3), but that's not valid. So perhaps the user intended that the parameter name is the same as the unit, but that's not possible. So the code uses the correct parameter names as per the timedelta.

So the code is correct. Now, I need to make sure that the code is written properly, with the correct error messages. Also, the function raises ValueError if the frequency can't be parsed. So in cases where the split parts are not two, or the number can't be parsed, or the unit is invalid.

Yes, that's handled.

Now, the code is written. Let me check for possible issues. For example, if the frequency is "3 days", then parts[0] is '3', which is converted to 3.0? Wait, no, float('3') is 3.0, but when passing to timedelta, it's okay. For example, datetime.timedelta(days=3.0) is valid.

But the problem's example uses an integer. However, the code uses float, which is more general. But maybe the user expects the number to be an integer. However, the problem says "number", which can be a float. So the code is correct.

But perhaps the function should accept integers only. But the problem statement isn't clear. However, the example uses an integer, but the code is written to handle floats. Well, the function's docstring says "number", which in Python can be a float. So it's better to use float.

So the code should be correct.
