Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called list_of_file_names and takes two parameters: settings_dirs and spec_option. The docstring says it should create and return a new IniType complex type using cli.ListOfFileNames().

Wait, the problem is that the user hasn't provided the actual implementation details. The function's purpose is to return an IniType, but how? The cli module's ListOfFileNames function probably processes the settings_dirs and spec_option to generate a list of file names. But without knowing what cli is or how ListOfFileNames works, I can't be sure. However, the user might be expecting a placeholder or a mock implementation based on the signature and the docstring.

Since the user specified not to include any explanation, I need to just write the code. The function needs to call cli.ListOfFileNames() with the given parameters. So maybe the code is as simple as importing cli and returning the result of that function. But I should check if the parameters are correctly passed. The function signature has settings_dirs and spec_option, so I'll pass them as arguments.

Wait, the user's example might be using a specific library or module. But since they didn't mention it, I'll assume that cli is a module available in the environment. So the code would be:

import cli

def list_of_file_names(settings_dirs, spec_option):
    """
    Create and return a new IniType complex type via cli.ListOfFileNames()
    """
    return cli.ListOfFileNames(settings_dirs, spec_option)

But maybe the function is supposed to do more? Like, perhaps the IniType is a class from cli, and ListOfFileNames is a method that returns an instance of it. However, the user's instruction is to generate code based on the given signature and docstring. The docstring says to use cli.ListOfFileNames(), which might be a function that returns the IniType. So the code is straightforward. I'll just write that.
