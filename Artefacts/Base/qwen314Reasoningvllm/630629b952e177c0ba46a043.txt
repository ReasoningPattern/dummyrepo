Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function get_nodeinfo_well_known_document based on the given signature and docstring. Let me think about what this function is supposed to do.

The function takes a url and an optional document_path. The docstring says it returns a formatted dictionary with info like url and document_path. So probably, it's constructing a dictionary that includes these parameters. But wait, what's the purpose of this function? Maybe it's related to fetching node information from a well-known document, like a .well-known file on a website. For example, some services use URLs like https://example.com/.well-known/nodeinfo to get metadata.

So the function might be designed to take the base URL and the document path, then combine them into a full URL. But the current parameters have the document_path as optional. If it's not provided, maybe the function uses a default path, like '/.well-known/nodeinfo'? That makes sense because the well-known document usually has a standard path.

The return value is a formatted dictionary. Let me check the parameters again. The function parameters are url and document_path. The dictionary should include these values. Wait, but maybe the function is supposed to construct a URL by combining the base URL with the document path. For example, if the url is 'https://example.com' and document_path is '/nodeinfo', the full URL would be 'https://example.com/nodeinfo'. But the well-known path is usually a specific one. Maybe the default document_path is '/.well-known/nodeinfo' if not provided.

So the function could be creating a dictionary with keys like 'url' and 'document_path', and maybe a 'full_url' key that combines them. Let me think about the structure. The user might want to have the base URL, the document path, and the full URL as parts of the returned dict. That would make sense for logging or further processing.

Wait, the docstring says "including information such as url and document_path". So maybe the dictionary just has those two keys. But perhaps the function is supposed to fetch the document from the URL, but the problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, not to implement the actual fetching. The user probably wants a function that returns a dictionary with the given parameters, maybe with some default values or processing.

Alternatively, maybe the function is meant to parse the well-known document's URL. But the parameters are url and document_path. If document_path is None, maybe it's using a default. Let me check the parameters again. The document_path is optional, so the function might combine the url with the document_path if provided, otherwise use a default.

So the code could look like this: define the function, set a default for document_path if it's None, then create a dictionary with url and document_path. But maybe the function is supposed to construct the full URL. For example, if the url is 'https://example.com' and document_path is '/.well-known/nodeinfo', then the full URL is 'https://example.com/.well-known/nodeinfo'.

But the docstring doesn't mention a full URL. It just says the dictionary includes url and document_path. So perhaps the function is just returning a dictionary with those two keys. However, the name of the function suggests that it's getting information from the well-known document. Maybe the actual implementation would involve making a request to that URL and parsing the JSON, but the user hasn't specified that. The user's instruction is to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, not to implement the functionality. So maybe the function is just a placeholder that returns a dictionary with the given parameters.

Wait, but the user says "generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring". The existing code is just the function definition with a docstring. The user probably wants me to fill in the function body. The docstring says it returns a formatted dictionary including url and document_path. So the function needs to create a dictionary that has those keys. But what's the format? Maybe it's a dictionary with 'url' and 'document_path' as keys, and their respective values. If document_path is None, perhaps it's set to a default value, like '/.well-known/nodeinfo'.

So the code would be:

def get_nodeinfo_well_known_document(url, document_path=None):
    """
    Returns a formatted dictionary, including information such as url and document_path.
    """
    if document_path is None:
        document_path = '/.well-known/nodeinfo'
    return {
        'url': url,
        'document_path': document_path,
        'full_url': f"{url}{document_path}"
    }

Wait, but the docstring doesn't mention 'full_url'. Maybe the dictionary should only include the url and document_path. But the user's example might need the full URL. Hmm, but the original docstring doesn't specify. Maybe the function is supposed to return a dictionary with those two parameters. However, the name suggests that it's about the well-known document, which typically has a standard path. So perhaps the document_path is optional, defaulting to the standard one. The function could then return a dictionary containing the base URL, the document path, and maybe the full URL constructed from them. But since the docstring doesn't mention the full URL, maybe it's better to just include the parameters as they are.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return a dictionary that includes the URL and the document path, but the document path is determined based on some logic. However, without more details, I have to go by the given info. The parameters are url and document_path, which is optional. The function returns a dictionary with those values. So perhaps the code is simply:

def get_nodeinfo_well_known_document(url, document_path=None):
    """
    Returns a formatted dictionary, including information such as url and document_path.
    """
    return {
        'url': url,
        'document_path': document_path
    }

But that seems too simple. However, the user might have intended for the function to construct the full URL. But the docstring doesn't mention that. Maybe the function is part of a larger system where the document path is used to form the URL, but the current task is just to return the given parameters in a dictionary. Since the docstring says "including information such as", maybe there are other fields as well, but the user hasn't specified. Without more details, I can't know. However, the user's instruction is to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring. The existing code has the function definition with parameters and a docstring. The user probably wants the function to return a dictionary with the parameters passed in. But maybe the document_path is optional, so if it's not provided, it's set to a default.

So the correct approach is to check if document_path is None and assign a default value. Then return a dictionary with both keys. The default value for document_path could be '/.well-known/nodeinfo' as that's a common path for such documents. So the code would include that logic. But the original docstring doesn't mention the default, so maybe the user expects that. However, the function's parameters have document_path as optional, so the function should handle that.

Therefore, the code would be:

def get_nodeinfo_well_known_document(url, document_path=None):
    """
    Returns a formatted dictionary, including information such as url and document_path.
    """
    if document_path is None:
        document_path = '/.well-known/nodeinfo'
    return {
        'url': url,
        'document_path': document_path
    }

But maybe the function is supposed to do more, like fetch the document. However, the user hasn't provided any details about that. The problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. The current docstring is very vague. The function's name suggests that it's retrieving node info from a well-known document, so perhaps the actual implementation would involve making a request. But since the user hasn't given any more details, maybe the function is just a placeholder that returns the parameters in a dictionary. Alternatively, maybe the user wants to have the function construct the full URL, even if the docstring doesn't mention it.

But given the information, the safest bet is to return a dictionary with the url and document_path as keys. The document_path can be set to a default if not provided. That's probably what the user is looking for.
