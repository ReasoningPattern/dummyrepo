Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function _get_conditionally_required_args based on the given signature and docstring. Let me think about what this function does.

The docstring says it lists arguments with required_when conditions matched. The parameters are command_name, options_spec, and args. The return is a list of argument names that meet the required_when condition.

So, the function is probably checking each option in options_spec to see if its required_when condition is met based on the provided args. The required_when might be a key in the options_spec that specifies under what conditions the argument is required.

First, I need to loop through each option in options_spec. For each option, check if it has a 'required_when' field. Then, determine if the condition in 'required_when' is satisfied by the args. If so, add the argument name to the result list.

But how is the 'required_when' condition structured? Maybe it's a dictionary or a list of conditions. For example, an option might have 'required_when': {'arg': 'value'}, meaning that if another argument has a certain value, this one is required.

Wait, the parameters include command_name, which might be used in the condition. Maybe the required_when is a function or a string that can be evaluated with the command name and args.

Alternatively, perhaps each option in options_spec has a 'required_when' that's a list of argument names that must be present for this argument to be required. For instance, if an option's required_when is ['--flag'], then if '--flag' is in args, this argument is needed.

But the problem is that the exact structure of options_spec isn't given. However, looking at the parameters, options_spec is a list of command spec options. Maybe each option is a dictionary with keys like 'name', 'required_when', etc.

So, the function's job is to go through each option in options_spec, check if the 'required_when' condition is met based on the args, and collect the names of those arguments that are required under those conditions.

Let me think about how to check the required_when. Suppose that for an option, required_when is a list of argument names that must be present in args. For example, if the option has required_when: ['--enable-feature'], then if '--enable-feature' is in the args, this argument is required.

But how do I check if the condition is met? Maybe the required_when is a list of arguments that need to be present. So, for each option, if all the arguments in required_when are present in args, then this option is required.

Alternatively, maybe required_when is a function that takes the args and returns True if the condition is met. But without knowing the exact structure, I have to make assumptions.

Looking at the parameters, the function is part of a class (since it's a method with self). Maybe the options_spec is a list of dictionaries, each representing an option. Each option might have a 'required_when' key that specifies conditions.

Let me consider an example. Suppose options_spec has an entry like {'name': 'arg1', 'required_when': {'arg2': True}}, meaning that if arg2 is present, then arg1 is required. Or maybe it's a list of conditions.

But since the user hasn't provided the exact structure, perhaps the code should check if the option has a 'required_when' key, and then check if the corresponding arguments in args meet that condition. However, without knowing how to evaluate the condition, I need to think of a way that's common in such scenarios.

Another approach: maybe required_when is a list of argument names that must be present in the args for this argument to be required. For example, if an option's required_when is ['--flag'], then if '--flag' is in args, this argument is required.

So, the code would iterate over each option in options_spec. For each option, check if 'required_when' is present. Then, check if all the arguments in required_when are present in args. If yes, then add the option's name to the result list.

Wait, but the function returns a list of argument names that are required because their required_when conditions are met. So, for each option in options_spec, if the required_when condition is satisfied by the current args, then include that option's name in the output list.

So, the code could look like this:

Initialize an empty list. For each option in options_spec, check if 'required_when' is in the option. If it is, check if the condition is met. How?

Assuming that required_when is a list of argument names that must be present. So, for example, if the option has required_when: ['--enable'], then if '--enable' is in args, this argument is required.

But maybe the required_when is a dictionary where the keys are argument names and the values are the expected values. For instance, {'arg': 'value'}, and if that argument is present with that value, then the current option is required.

But again, without knowing the exact structure, I need to make an assumption. Let me think of a common way this might be implemented. Perhaps the required_when is a list of arguments that must be present. So the code checks if all of those are in args.

Alternatively, maybe the required_when is a function that takes the command name and args and returns a boolean. But that would require more context.

Alternatively, maybe the required_when is a list of conditions, and each condition is a tuple of (arg_name, expected_value), and the code checks if any of those conditions are met.

But since the user hasn't specified, perhaps the code should check if the required_when is a list of arguments that are present in the args. For example, if the option's required_when is a list, then if all elements in that list are present in args, then the argument is required.

Wait, but the function is called with args, which is the received input arguments. So, perhaps args is a dictionary-like object, such as argparse.Namespace, where the keys are the argument names.

So, for each option in options_spec, if it has a 'required_when' key, then check if the condition is met. Let's assume that required_when is a list of argument names that must be present in args. If any of those are present, then the current argument is required. Or maybe all of them must be present.

Alternatively, maybe required_when is a string that represents a condition, like "arg1 is present and arg2 is not". But that would require parsing the string, which is more complex.

Given that the function is part of a command-line parser, perhaps the required_when is a list of arguments that, when present, trigger the requirement of this argument. For example, if an argument is required when another argument is present.

But I need to code this. Let me think of a possible structure. Suppose that options_spec is a list of dictionaries, each with 'name' and 'required_when' keys. The 'required_when' could be a list of argument names that, if present in args, make this argument required.

So, for each option in options_spec, if 'required_when' is present, check if any of the arguments in required_when are in args. If yes, then add the option's name to the result list.

Wait, but that might not be correct. Maybe required_when is a list of arguments that must be present for this argument to be required. For example, if the required_when is ['--flag'], then if --flag is present, this argument is required. But if the required_when is ['--flag', '--another'], then both must be present?

Alternatively, maybe it's a logical OR, so if any of the required_when arguments are present, then this argument is required. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe required_when is a function that takes the args and returns True if the condition is met. But again, without knowing the structure, it's hard.

Alternatively, maybe the required_when is a key in the options_spec that refers to another argument's value. For example, if required_when is 'arg2', then when arg2 is present, this argument is required.

But given the ambiguity, perhaps the code should check if the 'required_when' key exists in the option, and then check if the corresponding argument is present in args. For example, if the option has 'required_when': 'arg2', then if args has 'arg2', then this argument is required.

Alternatively, maybe required_when is a list of conditions. For example, if the required_when is ['--enable'], then if '--enable' is in args, this argument is required.

But I need to make an assumption here. Let's look at the parameters again. The function is called with command_name, options_spec, and args. The args could be a dictionary or an object with attributes.

Assuming that args is a dictionary-like object, perhaps the code checks for each option in options_spec whether the required_when condition is met by checking if the necessary arguments are present.

So, here's a possible approach:

Initialize an empty list. For each option in options_spec, check if 'required_when' is a key. Then, check if the condition is satisfied. For example, if required_when is a list of argument names, check if all of them are present in args. Or maybe check if any of them are present. But which?

Alternatively, perhaps required_when is a list of (arg_name, value) pairs. For example, if the option's required_when is [('arg2', 'value1')], then if args.arg2 is 'value1', then this argument is required.

But again, without knowing the exact structure, it's challenging. However, given the function's purpose, maybe the required_when is a list of arguments that must be present for this argument to be required.

So, the code would be something like:

def _get_conditionally_required_args(self, command_name, options_spec, args):
    required_args = []
    for option in options_spec:
        if 'required_when' in option:
            # Check if the condition is met
            if self._check_required_when(option['required_when'], args):
                required_args.append(option['name'])
    return required_args

But then, the _check_required_when method would need to be defined. However, the user hasn't provided that, so maybe the code should inline that check.

Alternatively, maybe required_when is a list of argument names that must be present. So for each option, if the required_when list is not empty, and all the arguments in required_when are present in args, then add the option's name to the list.

Wait, but that might not make sense. For example, if required_when is ['--enable'], then if --enable is present, the current argument is required. So perhaps the check is whether any of the required_when arguments are present.

But I think the most common scenario is that required_when is a list of arguments that, if present, make this argument required. So, for example, if an argument is required when another argument is present. So, for each option, if the required_when list is not empty, and any of the arguments in required_when are present in args, then this argument is required.

But how to implement that? Let's say args is a dictionary. For each required_when argument in the option's required_when list, check if it's in args. If any are present, then include the option's name in the result.

Alternatively, maybe the required_when is a list of arguments that must all be present. For example, if required_when is ['--enable', '--feature'], then both must be present for the current argument to be required.

But without more info, perhaps the code should check if the required_when is a list of argument names that are present in args. So, if the required_when list is non-empty and all the arguments in it are present in args, then the current option is required.

Alternatively, maybe it's a list of conditions where each condition is a key in args. For example, if the required_when is ['--enable'], then if '--enable' is in args, the current argument is required.

So, the code would check if any of the required_when arguments are in args. If yes, then add the current option's name to the list.

But I'm not sure. Maybe the required_when is a list of arguments that must be present for the current argument to be required. So, the presence of any of those arguments would trigger the requirement.

Alternatively, maybe it's a list of arguments that must be absent. But that's less likely.

Alternatively, the required_when could be a function that takes the command name and args and returns whether the argument is required. But again, without knowing, it's hard.

Another approach: perhaps the options_spec is structured such that each option has a 'required_when' key that is a list of argument names. The function checks if any of those arguments are present in the args. If so, then this argument is required.

So, for example, if an option has required_when: ['--flag'], and args contains '--flag', then this argument is required.

In that case, the code would loop through each option, check if 'required_when' exists, and then check if any of the arguments in required_when are present in args. If yes, then add the option's name to the list.

But how to check if the arguments in required_when are present in args. Let's assume args is a dictionary-like object, so we can check if the argument name is a key in args.

So, the code could be:

def _get_conditionally_required_args(self, command_name, options_spec, args):
    required_args = []
    for option in options_spec:
        if 'required_when' in option:
            # Check if any of the required_when arguments are present
            if any(arg in args for arg in option['required_when']):
                required_args.append(option['name'])
    return required_args

But that's assuming that required_when is a list of argument names. However, maybe the required_when is a single argument name. For example, if the option's required_when is 'arg2', then check if 'arg2' is in args.

Alternatively, maybe required_when is a list, and the code checks if all arguments in the list are present. But again, without knowing, I need to make an assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps the required_when is a list of (arg_name, value) pairs, and the code checks if the args have those values. For example, if required_when is [('arg2', True)], then check if args.arg2 is True.

But again, without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to code.

Wait, looking at the parameters again: the function is called with command_name, options_spec, and args. The options_spec could be a list of options, each with their own parameters, including required_when. Maybe required_when is a list of conditions that are checked against the args.

But since the user hasn't provided the exact structure, perhaps the code is part of a larger system where options_spec is a list of options, each with a 'required_when' key that is a list of argument names. The function checks if any of those arguments are present in the args, and if so, adds the current option's name to the required list.

Alternatively, maybe the required_when is a list of arguments that must be present for the current argument to be required. So, for example, if the required_when is ['--enable'], then when --enable is present, this argument is required.

In that case, the code would check for each option in options_spec if the required_when list is non-empty and if any of the arguments in that list are present in args. If so, then the option's name is added to the list.

But I need to make sure that the code is as per the function's purpose. The function returns the list of argument names that are required because their required_when conditions are met.

So, perhaps the code is:

def _get_conditionally_required_args(self, command_name, options_spec, args):
    required = []
    for opt in options_spec:
        if 'required_when' in opt:
            # Check if the condition is met
            condition_met = False
            for arg in opt['required_when']:
                if arg in args:
                    condition_met = True
                    break
            if condition_met:
                required.append(opt['name'])
    return required

This code loops through each option in options_spec. If the option has a 'required_when' key, it checks if any of the arguments in that list are present in args. If yes, then the option's name is added to the required list.

But maybe the required_when is a list of arguments that must all be present. For example, if the required_when is ['--enable', '--feature'], then both must be present. In that case, the code would check if all args in required_when are in args.

But again, without knowing, it's a guess. However, the function's name suggests that it's checking for required arguments when certain conditions are met. So, the presence of any of the required_when arguments would trigger the requirement.

Alternatively, maybe the required_when is a list of argument names that are required to be present for this argument to be required. So, for example, if the current option's required_when is ['--enable'], then if '--enable' is present in args, then this option is required.

But the code above would check if any of the required_when arguments are present. That seems plausible.

Another possibility is that the required_when is a function, but that would require more code. However, since the user hasn't provided that, maybe the code is simpler.

Alternatively, maybe the required_when is a list of conditions that are checked against the args. For example, if the required_when is ['--enable'], then the presence of '--enable' in args makes this argument required.

So, the code would check if any of the required_when arguments are present in args. If yes, then the current option is required.

Thus, the code would be as I wrote earlier.

But I need to make sure that the code is using the correct parameters. The function's parameters are command_name, options_spec, and args. The code doesn't use command_name, which might be a problem. Wait, the function's docstring says that command_name is the command name. Maybe the required_when condition depends on the command name. For example, an argument is required only when a certain command is used.

But in the current code, command_name is not used. That might be an issue. So perhaps the required_when is a condition that involves the command name and the args.

Hmm, this complicates things. For example, maybe the required_when is a function that takes command_name and args as parameters. But again, without knowing the structure, it's hard.

Alternatively, maybe the options_spec includes conditions that are based on the command name. For example, if the command is 'start', then certain arguments are required.

But the code as written earlier doesn't use command_name. That might be an oversight. However, the user's docstring says that the function returns arguments with matched required_when conditions. Maybe the required_when is a list of arguments that are present, and the command_name is not directly used here. Perhaps the required_when is part of the options_spec, which may have conditions that are not related to the command name.

But given that the function is called with command_name, perhaps the required_when condition depends on the command name. For example, the required_when could be a key that refers to the command name.

But again, without knowing the exact structure, I have to proceed with assumptions.

Maybe the code is part of a system where each option's required_when is a list of arguments that must be present in the args. The command_name is perhaps used in other parts of the code, but not here. So the code I wrote earlier is acceptable.

Another thing: the args parameter is a list, but in Python, when you parse command-line arguments, args is usually a Namespace object. However, the code may be checking if the argument names are present in the args. So, for example, if args is a Namespace, then checking if an argument is present would involve checking if hasattr(args, arg) or something like that.

But the code as written assumes that args is a dictionary. However, if args is a Namespace, then the code would need to check if the argument exists as an attribute.

So, perhaps the code should check if the argument is in args as a key, or if it's an attribute. But again, without knowing the exact type of args, it's tricky.

Alternatively, maybe the args is a dictionary, and the code checks if the key exists.

But given that the user hasn't specified, I'll proceed with the assumption that args is a dictionary-like object, and that required_when is a list of argument names that must be present in args.

So, the code would be:

def _get_conditionally_required_args(self, command_name, options_spec, args):
    required_args = []
    for option in options_spec:
        if 'required_when' in option:
            # Check if any of the required_when arguments are present in args
            if any(arg in args for arg in option['required_when']):
                required_args.append(option['name'])
    return required_args

But perhaps the required_when is a list of arguments that must be present for the current argument to be required. However, if the required_when is a list, then the code checks if any of them are present.

Alternatively, maybe the required_when is a list of arguments that are required to be present for this argument to be required. So, if all are present, then this is required. But that's a different logic.

But given that the function's name is "get_conditionally_required_args", it's possible that the required_when is a condition that, when met, makes the argument required. For example, if an argument is required when another argument is present.

So, the code would check if the condition is met. For example, if the required_when is a list of arguments that are present, then the current argument is required.

In that case, the code checks if any of the required_when arguments are in args. If yes, then the current argument is required.

But I think that's a reasonable assumption. So, the code would be as above.

Wait, but the function returns a list of argument names that are required because their required_when conditions are met. So, the code is collecting the names of the arguments that are conditionally required based on the presence of other arguments.

Therefore, the code loops through each option in options_spec. For each, if the option has a required_when list, and any of those arguments are present in args, then the option's name is added to the required_args list.

That seems plausible. So, the generated code would be:

def _get_conditionally_required_args(self, command_name, options_spec, args):
    required_args = []
    for option in options_spec:
        if 'required_when' in option:
            # Check if any of the required_when arguments are present in args
            if any(arg in args for arg in option['required_when']):
                required_args.append(option['name'])
    return required_args

But I need to make sure that the code uses the correct parameters. The command_name is not used here, but maybe it's part of the condition. For example, the required_when could be a list of (command, arg) pairs. But again, without knowing, it's hard.

Alternatively, maybe the required_when is a list of arguments that must be present in the args. So, the code is correct as is.

Another thing: the options_spec might be a list of options, each with their own parameters. So, each option is a dictionary with keys like 'name', 'required_when', etc.

So, the code is correct. But I need to make sure that the 'name' key is present in each option.

But given that the function is supposed to return the list of argument names, the code assumes that each option has a 'name' key.

Thus, the code seems to fit the description. However, I should check if there's any other possible way.

Alternatively, maybe the required_when is a list of conditions that are evaluated using the command name and the args. For example, if the command is 'create' and a certain argument is present.

But again, without knowing, the code can't be written accurately. So, the best approach is to assume that required_when is a list of argument names that must be present in args for this argument to be required.

Thus, the code would be as written above.
