Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called 'pretty' and takes 'indent' and 'debug' parameters. The docstring mentions returning a pretty formatted representation of 'self'. 

First, I need to figure out what the function is supposed to do. The docstring has a line that says obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj). So, it looks like the function is trying to format the 'obj' attribute of the instance. If the obj is a string, it wraps it in quotes, otherwise uses the repr.

Then, the return statement is supposed to create a string that starts with indent spaces, followed by the class name, and then some debug details and the obj. But the debug_details part isn't defined in the docstring. Maybe that's a placeholder for some debug information that's generated based on the 'debug' parameter?

Wait, the original code in the docstring seems incomplete. The return line has "debug_details" which isn't explained. So perhaps the user intended for that part to be handled conditionally. For example, if debug is True, include some debug info, else just the obj.

The function is a method, so 'self' is the instance. The 'indent' parameter defaults to 0, and 'debug' to False. The goal is to format the object in a way that's readable, possibly for debugging.

So, putting it all together: The function should generate a string representation of the object, with indentation, using the class name, and including debug details if the debug flag is set. The obj is formatted as a string with quotes if it's a string, else using repr.

But how to handle the debug_details? Maybe when debug is True, we add some information like the object's attributes or other debug-related data. However, the original docstring doesn't specify what debug_details is. Since the user provided the docstring as is, maybe they expect that part to be filled in based on standard practices.

Alternatively, perhaps the debug_details is a variable that's supposed to be constructed based on the debug parameter. For example, if debug is True, we might include more details like the object's id or other attributes. But without more context, it's a bit unclear. However, looking at the return statement structure, it seems that debug_details is a string that's concatenated with the obj.

Wait, the original code in the docstring has a line that starts with return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})". So, the debug_details is probably a string that's built when debug is True. Maybe something like ", debug=True" or other details. But the user's example code is incomplete here.

Hmm, perhaps the user intended for the debug_details to be generated based on the debug parameter. For example, if debug is True, then include some debug information, otherwise leave it as an empty string. But how?

Let me think. The original code in the docstring is a bit of a clue. The line is:

return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"

So, the debug_details variable is part of the formatted string. But in the code provided, it's not defined. Maybe the user made a typo or left it as a placeholder. So, perhaps the actual code should generate debug_details based on the debug parameter.

If debug is True, maybe we add something like "debug=True" as part of the string. Otherwise, it's an empty string. Let me try to reconstruct that.

So, inside the function, first, we process the obj. Then, we need to create debug_details. For example:

debug_details = ", debug=True" if debug else ""

Then, the return statement would be as in the docstring. But the original code in the docstring has a line that starts with obj = ... and then the return line. So, the code should first compute obj, then compute debug_details, then return the formatted string.

Putting it all together, the function would look like:

def pretty(self, indent=0, debug=False):
    obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj)
    debug_details = ", debug=True" if debug else ""
    return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"

Wait, but the user's docstring shows that the return line is part of the code. However, in the given docstring, the code is written as a single line, but in reality, it's probably split into multiple lines for readability. But the user's example has the return line as a single line. However, the user's instruction is to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. The docstring's code seems to be a mix of comments and actual code. Maybe the user intended that the code in the docstring is the actual code they want implemented.

Wait, the original docstring has:

"""
Return a pretty formatted representation of self. obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj) return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"
"""

But that's a bit confusing. It seems like the docstring is trying to describe the code, but the line is a bit jumbled. Maybe the user made a mistake in formatting the docstring. The line after "Return..." is probably the code they want, but split into two parts. So, the code inside the docstring is:

obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj)
return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"

But in the docstring, it's written as a single line. So, the user's code may have a typo, but I need to generate the correct code based on that.

The problem is that 'debug_details' is not defined. So perhaps the user intended that when debug is True, some debug information is added. But how?

Alternatively, maybe 'debug_details' is a variable that is supposed to be constructed from the debug parameter. For example, if debug is True, then include some debug string, else not. But the original code doesn't show that. So maybe the user intended that the debug_details is part of the return statement, but perhaps it's a mistake. Maybe they meant to have something like:

return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({obj}, debug={debug})"

But that's just a guess. However, the original code in the docstring has 'debug_details' which is undefined. So perhaps the user intended that the debug_details is a variable that's built based on the debug parameter. For example, if debug is True, then debug_details is something like ", debug=True", else an empty string.

So, putting that together, the code would be:

def pretty(self, indent=0, debug=False):
    obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj)
    debug_details = ", debug=True" if debug else ""
    return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"

But I need to make sure that this is what the user wants. The original docstring's code seems to have a line that assigns obj and then returns the formatted string. The debug_details is part of the return statement, but it's not defined. So the user probably intended to have that variable defined based on the debug parameter.

Another possibility is that 'debug_details' is a typo and should be something else. But given the information, I have to go with what's provided.

So, the code would first compute obj, then compute debug_details, then return the formatted string. That seems to be the correct approach. Therefore, the generated code would include that logic.
