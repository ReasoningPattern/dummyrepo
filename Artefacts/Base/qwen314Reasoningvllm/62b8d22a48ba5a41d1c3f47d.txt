Okay, I need to generate Python code for the `pop` method based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me think about how the built-in `pop` method works in dictionaries. The method removes the key and returns its value, and if the key isn't found, it returns the default or raises a KeyError.

First, the function is defined as `def pop(self, key, default=__marker):`. The `__marker` is probably a sentinel value used to check if the default was provided. In Python's `dict.pop`, if the default isn't given, it raises a KeyError. So, I need to handle that case.

The docstring says that if the key is not found, return `d` if given, else raise KeyError. So, the code should check if the key exists in the dictionary. If it does, delete it and return the value. If not, check if a default was provided. If yes, return that default; if not, raise KeyError.

Wait, but in Python, the `pop` method for dictionaries has the signature `pop(self, key, default=None)`, and the default is optional. However, the user's code uses `__marker` as the default. That's probably a placeholder to indicate that the default wasn't provided. So, in the implementation, if `default` is `__marker`, then we should raise KeyError when the key is not found. Otherwise, return the default.

So, the steps are:

1. Check if the key is present in the dictionary.
2. If present, remove it and return its value.
3. If not present, check if a default was provided (i.e., not `__marker`).
4. If default is provided, return it.
5. If not, raise KeyError.

But how to implement this in Python? Let's think about the `__marker` variable. It's likely a private variable defined in the class, maybe as an instance variable or a class-level constant. However, since the user hasn't provided the class definition, I need to assume that `__marker` is a predefined value that signifies the absence of a default.

Wait, in the standard `dict.pop`, the default is `None` if not provided. But in the given signature, the default is `__marker`, which suggests that the class might have a different way of handling defaults. Maybe `__marker` is a special value that's not a valid value for the dictionary, so when the user calls `pop` without a default, it's supposed to raise KeyError.

So, the code would be something like:

if key in self:
    value = self[key]
    del self[key]
    return value
else:
    if default is not __marker:
        return default
    else:
        raise KeyError(key)

But I need to make sure that `__marker` is defined. However, the user's code doesn't show that. Maybe it's a predefined value in the class, like a private variable. But since the code is part of a class (as `self` is present), perhaps the `__marker` is a class-level attribute or a module-level constant. However, without more context, I'll proceed with the assumption that `__marker` is a valid identifier in the scope where this method is defined.

Another thing: in Python, when you use `del self[key]`, it removes the key from the dictionary. So the code should do that.

Putting it all together, the method would check for the key's presence. If found, delete and return. If not, check the default. But how is `__marker` handled? Maybe the original code uses a sentinel value, like `object()`, to distinguish between a user-provided default and the absence of one. For example, in some implementations, `__marker` could be a unique object that's not a valid value. But in the standard `dict.pop`, the default is `None` if not provided. However, the user's docstring says that if `d` is given, return it, else raise KeyError. So the code should follow that logic.

Wait, the default parameter in the function is set to `__marker`, which is probably a placeholder. So when the user calls `pop` without a default, it's `__marker`, and we need to check if that's the case. If the default is `__marker`, then we raise KeyError. Otherwise, return the default.

So, the code would be:

def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
    if key in self:
        return self.pop(key)
    else:
        if default is not __marker:
            return default
        else:
            raise KeyError(key)

Wait, but that's using the built-in `pop` method. However, maybe the user wants to implement it from scratch, like in a custom dictionary class. But the question says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. Since the function is part of a class (with `self`), it's likely that this is a method of a custom dictionary-like class. But the user hasn't provided the class definition, so perhaps the code is meant to be part of a class that has a `__dict__` or similar structure.

Alternatively, maybe the code is intended to be a method of a class that mimics a dictionary. But without knowing the exact structure, I'll proceed with the standard approach, assuming that `self` is a dictionary-like object with a `__dict__` attribute or similar.

Wait, but the standard `dict.pop` is implemented in C for efficiency, but here we are writing a Python method. So, perhaps the code is for a custom class that has a dictionary as an attribute. For example, if `self` has a `data` dictionary, then the code would check `key` in `self.data`, and so on.

But the original function signature doesn't mention any such attribute. The method is called `pop` and takes `self`, `key`, and `default`. So, perhaps the class is a subclass of `dict`, and this is an overridden method. However, in that case, the standard `pop` method would already be there. Alternatively, maybe the class is a wrapper around a dictionary, and this `pop` method is accessing the underlying data.

But given the lack of context, perhaps the user expects a standard implementation similar to the built-in `dict.pop`. However, the presence of `__marker` suggests that maybe the default is not `None` but a specific marker. But in Python, the default for `pop` is `None` if not provided. However, the user's code uses `__marker` as the default. So, perhaps the code is part of a class where `__marker` is a predefined value, like a private constant.

In any case, the code should check if the key exists, remove it, return the value, else return the default if provided, else raise KeyError.

So, the code would be:

def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
    if key in self:
        value = self[key]
        del self[key]
        return value
    else:
        if default is not __marker:
            return default
        else:
            raise KeyError(key)

But I need to make sure that `__marker` is defined. However, the user's code doesn't include that. Maybe `__marker` is a predefined value in the class, like a private variable. But since the user hasn't provided that, perhaps it's a typo or placeholder. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to use `None` as the default, but the code uses `__marker` as a sentinel.

Wait, in the standard `dict.pop`, the default is `None` if not provided. But in the given function signature, the default is `__marker`. So, perhaps the code is meant to be part of a class that uses `__marker` as a sentinel to check if the default was provided. For example, in some implementations, people use a unique object as a sentinel to differentiate between a user-provided default and the absence of one.

But in the absence of knowing what `__marker` is, perhaps the code is intended to be written as a method of a class that has a `__dict__` attribute. However, that's just a guess.

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to the `pop` method of a class that's a dictionary subclass, and `__marker` is a class-level attribute. But again, without more context, I have to proceed with the information given.

Assuming that `__marker` is a predefined value, perhaps the code is as follows. Also, note that in Python, if you don't provide a default, the method should raise KeyError. So, the code should check if the default is `__marker` (i.e., the user didn't provide a default) and then raise the error.

So, the code would be:

def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
    """
    D.pop(k[,d]) -> v, remove specified key and return the corresponding value.
    If key is not found, d is returned if given, otherwise KeyError is raised.
    """
    if key in self:
        value = self[key]
        del self[key]
        return value
    else:
        if default is not __marker:
            return default
        else:
            raise KeyError(key)

But I need to make sure that `__marker` is defined. However, the user's code may have `__marker` defined elsewhere, perhaps as a private variable in the class. But since the user hasn't included that, I can't add it. The code as given would work if `__marker` is defined in the class's scope.

Alternatively, maybe `__marker` is a typo and should be `None`, but the user's code uses `__marker` as the default. So, I have to stick with that.

Another thing: in Python, the `pop` method for a dictionary returns the value and removes the key. So, the code above is correct in that sense. It checks if the key is present, retrieves the value, deletes the key, and returns the value. If not present, checks the default.

But wait, the code uses `self[key]` which would raise a KeyError if the key is not present. However, the code first checks if `key in self`, so that part is safe.

Yes, that should work. So, the generated code would be as above.
