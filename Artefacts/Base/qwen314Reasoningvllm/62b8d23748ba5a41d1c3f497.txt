Okay, I need to generate Python code for the popitem method based on the given docstring. The docstring says it removes and returns the least frequently used (key, value) pair. Hmm, that sounds like it's related to a cache or something that tracks usage frequency. Oh right, the OrderedDict from the collections module has a popitem method that can remove the least recently used item, but maybe this is for an LRU cache?

Wait, the user didn't specify the class this method belongs to. But the function signature is def popitem(self), so it's probably part of a class. The most common scenario where popitem is used with such a docstring is in an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache implementation. However, the standard library's OrderedDict has a move_to_end method and popitem with last=False to get the least recently used. But maybe the user wants a custom implementation?

Alternatively, if this is part of a class that maintains a frequency count, like a LFU (Least Frequently Used) cache, then the popitem would need to find the item with the lowest frequency. But the problem is, the current code doesn't have any context about the class's attributes. So I need to make some assumptions here.

Assuming that this is an LRU cache, the popitem method would remove the least recently used item. But the standard OrderedDict's popitem with last=False does that. However, if the user is expecting a custom implementation, perhaps they want to use a dictionary and a separate structure to track usage.

Wait, but the user hasn't provided any existing code structure. So maybe they just want the method that uses OrderedDict's functionality. Let me think. If the class is using an OrderedDict, then the popitem method could be implemented as:

def popitem(self):
    return self._cache.popitem(last=False)

But that's if the class has an OrderedDict instance variable called _cache. However, the user's docstring says "least frequently used," not "least recently used." So maybe it's a LFU cache. In that case, the implementation would be more complex, requiring tracking of frequencies.

But without knowing the class's internal structure, it's hard to implement. The user might be expecting a standard approach. Let me check the Python documentation. The standard library's OrderedDict's popitem() with last=False removes the first inserted item, which is LRU. However, if the docstring says "least frequently used," perhaps the user is working on a custom LFU cache.

In that case, the class would need to track the frequency of each key. So, maybe the class has a dictionary for the cache and another structure, like a Counter, to track frequencies. Then, when popitem is called, it finds the key with the minimum frequency and removes it.

But how to handle ties? If multiple items have the same frequency, which one to remove? Typically, in LFU, if there's a tie, the least recently used among them is removed. But that complicates things. Alternatively, maybe the class uses a heap to track the least frequent items.

Alternatively, if the user is referring to a standard data structure, perhaps they want to use the OrderedDict's popitem with last=False, but the docstring mentions "least frequently used," which might be a mistake. Or maybe they want to implement a LFU cache.

Since the user hasn't provided the class's attributes, I need to make an educated guess. Let's assume that the class is an LFU cache and has a dictionary called _cache and a frequency counter called _freq. The method would then find the key with the minimum frequency, remove it from the cache, and return the key-value pair.

But to implement that, the code would need to iterate through the items in _cache, find the one with the minimum _freq value, then pop it. However, this is inefficient for large caches. But maybe for the sake of this problem, the user just wants a basic implementation.

So, here's a possible approach:

- Iterate through the items in self._cache.
- For each item, check its frequency in self._freq.
- Find the item with the minimum frequency.
- If there are multiple items with the same minimum frequency, perhaps pick the first one (or use some other tiebreaker).
- Remove that item from both _cache and _freq.
- Return the (key, value) pair.

But again, without knowing the exact structure, this is speculative. Another possibility is that the user is working with a class that has a list or another structure to track usage frequency. Alternatively, maybe they are using a third-party library or a custom data structure.

Alternatively, if the class is a subclass of dict, and the popitem method is supposed to remove the least frequently used item, perhaps the class maintains a frequency count for each key. For example, every time a key is accessed, its frequency is incremented. Then, when popitem is called, it finds the key with the lowest frequency.

But how to track that? Let's think of a simple example. Suppose the class has a _frequency dictionary that tracks how many times each key has been accessed. Then, the popitem would find the key with the minimum value in _frequency, remove it from the main cache, and return it.

But in that case, the code would be something like:

def popitem(self):
    min_freq = min(self._frequency.values())
    candidates = [k for k, v in self._frequency.items() if v == min_freq]
    key = candidates[0]
    value = self._cache.pop(key)
    self._frequency.pop(key)
    return key, value

But this is assuming the presence of _cache and _frequency attributes. However, the user hasn't provided that context. Maybe the method is part of a class that uses a different approach. Since the user only provided the function signature and docstring, perhaps the intended answer is to use OrderedDict's popitem with last=False, even though the docstring says "least frequently used" instead of "least recently used."

Alternatively, maybe the user made a typo, and the intended behavior is LRU. But I can't be sure. However, given that the docstring says "least frequently used," it's more likely to be LFU.

But without knowing the internal structure, I can't write the correct code. Maybe the user expects the code to use the standard OrderedDict's method. Let me check the standard Python libraries again.

Wait, the OrderedDict's popitem() with last=False removes the earliest inserted item, which is LRU. So if the docstring says "least frequently used," perhaps there's a misunderstanding here. However, the user might have intended LRU, so maybe that's the case.

Alternatively, maybe the class is using a different approach. Since the user hasn't provided any code, perhaps the answer is to use the OrderedDict's method. But how to know?

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a Counter, but that's not a standard use case for popitem. Hmm.

Alternatively, the method is part of a class that maintains a list of items sorted by frequency. For example, a list that's kept sorted, and when popitem is called, it removes the first element.

But again, without knowing the class's attributes, I can't proceed. However, given that the user provided only the function signature and docstring, perhaps they are expecting a standard implementation using OrderedDict, even if the docstring is slightly off. Or maybe they are using a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the user is working on a custom LFU cache and the popitem method is supposed to remove the least frequently used item. Let me think of how to implement that.

In a LFU cache, each time a key is accessed, its frequency is incremented. When evicting, the least frequent is removed. So the class would need to track frequencies. Let's assume that the class has a _cache dictionary and a _freq dictionary. Then, the popitem method would find the key with the minimum frequency.

But how to handle multiple keys with the same frequency? In LFU, if there's a tie, the least recently used among them is evicted. But that requires tracking both frequency and usage time.

Alternatively, maybe the user is using a heap to track the least frequent items. For example, a heap that stores tuples of (frequency, key), and when popitem is called, it pops the item with the smallest frequency. However, maintaining the heap would require updating frequencies when items are accessed.

But again, without knowing the class structure, it's challenging. Since the user hasn't provided any context, perhaps the best approach is to use the OrderedDict's popitem with last=False, assuming that the docstring's mention of "least frequently used" is a mistake and they meant "least recently used."

Alternatively, maybe the user wants a method that removes the item with the least frequency, and the class has a frequency counter. For example:

class LFUCache:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cache = {}
        self.freq = defaultdict(int)
        self.usage = []

    def popitem(self):
        """
        Remove and return the `(key, value)` pair least frequently used.
        """
        if not self.cache:
            raise KeyError('cache is empty')
        # Find the key with the minimum frequency
        min_freq = min(self.freq.values())
        # Get all keys with that frequency
        candidates = [k for k in self.cache if self.freq[k] == min_freq]
        # If multiple, pick the first one (or use some other criteria)
        key = candidates[0]
        value = self.cache.pop(key)
        self.freq.pop(key)
        return key, value

But this is a very basic implementation and may not handle ties properly. Also, the usage list isn't used here. Maybe the usage list is for tracking the order in case of ties.

Alternatively, if the class is using a Counter, but that's not directly applicable.

Wait, the user's function signature is part of a class, but the class isn't specified. So the answer depends on the context. Since the user hasn't provided any code, perhaps they expect the code to use the OrderedDict's method, even if the docstring is slightly incorrect.

But the docstring says "least frequently used," which is different from LRU. So maybe the correct approach is to use a LFU cache implementation. However, without knowing the internal variables, I can't code that accurately.

Alternatively, maybe the user is using a different data structure. For example, a dictionary with a separate list that keeps track of items sorted by frequency. But again, without knowing the structure, this is guesswork.

Given the ambiguity, perhaps the intended answer is to use the OrderedDict's popitem with last=False, assuming that the docstring's mention of "least frequently used" is a mistake. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the user might have a custom data structure.

Alternatively, maybe the class is a subclass of dict and has a method to track frequencies. For example, every time a key is accessed, it's incremented in a frequency dictionary. Then, popitem would find the key with the minimum frequency.

But again, the code would need to have those attributes. Since the user hasn't provided that, maybe the answer is to use the OrderedDict approach. But I need to check the standard Python libraries again.

Wait, in Python 3.7+, regular dicts preserve insertion order. However, the popitem() method for a regular dict pops the last inserted item. So if the class is using a regular dict and wants to implement LFU, that's not directly possible with popitem.

Alternatively, the user is working on a class that uses a list to track the order of usage, and when popitem is called, it finds the item with the lowest frequency. But again, without knowing the internal structure, it's hard to code.

Given that the user hasn't provided any code, perhaps the correct approach is to implement a basic LFU cache with the necessary attributes. However, since the function is part of a class, and the user hasn't given any context, maybe the answer is to use the OrderedDict's popitem method with last=False, and the docstring might have a typo.

But the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. So the code should be written in a way that fits the docstring. Therefore, the code should remove the least frequently used item.

Assuming that the class has a _freq dictionary that tracks the frequency of each key, and a _cache dictionary that holds the items. Then, the popitem method would find the key with the minimum frequency in _freq, remove it from _cache and _freq, and return it.

So here's a possible implementation:

def popitem(self):
    """
    Remove and return the `(key, value)` pair least frequently used.
    """
    if not self._cache:
        raise KeyError("Cache is empty")
    # Find the key with the minimum frequency
    min_freq = min(self._freq.values())
    # Get all keys with that frequency
    candidates = [k for k, v in self._freq.items() if v == min_freq]
    # Choose the first one (assuming some order)
    key = candidates[0]
    value = self._cache.pop(key)
    self._freq.pop(key)
    return (key, value)

But this code assumes that the class has _cache and _freq attributes. However, the user hasn't provided that, so maybe this is part of a larger class. But since the user hasn't given any other code, perhaps this is acceptable.

Alternatively, if the class is using a Counter for frequencies, but that's not directly applicable.

Another possibility is that the user is referring to a standard library module that I'm not aware of. But I think the most probable scenario is that this is part of a LFU cache implementation, and the code is supposed to use the _freq and _cache attributes.

But since the user hasn't provided the class definition, I can't be certain. However, given the docstring, I'll proceed with the LFU approach, assuming that the class has the necessary attributes.
