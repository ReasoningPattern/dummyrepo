Okay, I need to write a Python function called split that takes a string s and a platform parameter. The platform can be 'this', 1, or 0. The function should split the string according to the platform's style. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the default platform is 'this', which means I have to auto-detect the current platform. How do I do that in Python? Oh right, using the os module. The os.name gives the name of the operating system. For POSIX systems like Linux or macOS, os.name is 'posix', and for Windows, it's 'nt'. So if platform is 'this', I can check os.name and decide between POSIX or Windows style.

Next, if the platform is 1, use POSIX style splitting. POSIX uses spaces, tabs, and newlines as separators. But wait, the default split function in Python splits on whitespace, which might be similar. However, maybe the user wants to split on specific characters like semicolons or colons? Wait, no, the problem says "split the input str under given platform". Oh, maybe it's about splitting paths? Like, splitting a file path into components based on the OS's path separator.

Wait, the function's docstring says that when platform is 1, use POSIX style, and 0 for Windows/CMD. So perhaps the function is meant to split the string using the appropriate path separator for the platform. For example, POSIX uses '/', Windows uses '\'.

But the function is named split, which is similar to the built-in str.split() function. However, the built-in split uses a separator, but here the separator depends on the platform. So the task is to split the string s using the platform-specific delimiter.

So for platform 1 (POSIX), split on '/'. For platform 0 (Windows), split on '\'. But wait, in Windows paths, the separator is backslash, but in Python strings, backslash is an escape character. So when splitting, I need to use the correct delimiter. Also, when platform is 'this', check the current OS and use the corresponding delimiter.

But how to handle the splitting? For example, if the input string is a path like "home/user/file.txt", splitting on '/' would give ["home", "user", "file.txt"]. Similarly, a Windows path "C:\user\file.txt" would split into ["C:", "user", "file.txt"] if using backslash.

Wait, but the function's return is a list of splitting str. So the function is supposed to split the input string into parts based on the platform's path separator.

So the steps are:

1. Determine the delimiter based on the platform parameter.
2. Split the string s using that delimiter.
3. Return the resulting list.

But how to handle the platform parameter. Let's outline:

If platform is 'this', then check os.name. If os.name is 'posix', use '/', else use '\'.

If platform is 1, use '/'.

If platform is 0, use '\'.

But wait, in Python, the backslash in a string is an escape character. So when splitting, I need to use a single backslash as the separator. However, in a string, to represent a single backslash, I need to use two backslashes. So for example, splitting on '\\' for Windows.

So the code would first determine the correct delimiter. Then use the split method with that delimiter.

But wait, the built-in split method splits on every occurrence of the delimiter. So for example, "a/b/c".split('/') gives ['a', 'b', 'c'].

But what about if the platform is 'this'? Let me check. For example, on Windows, the delimiter is backslash, so splitting the string using that.

So the code could be:

import os

def split(s, platform='this'):
    if platform == 'this':
        if os.name == 'posix':
            delimiter = '/'
        else:
            delimiter = '\\'
    elif platform == 1:
        delimiter = '/'
    elif platform == 0:
        delimiter = '\\'
    else:
        # handle invalid platform? But the docstring says platform is 'this', 1, or 0. So maybe assume valid input.
        # Or maybe raise an error? The problem doesn't specify, so perhaps just proceed with default.
        # But the default is 'this', so maybe the else case is not needed. But to be safe, maybe handle it.
        # However, the problem says platform is either 'this', 1, or 0. So perhaps no need for error checking here.
        # For now, proceed with the given options.

    # Now split the string using the delimiter
    return s.split(delimiter)

Wait, but what if the platform is something else? The function's parameters say platform can be 'this', 1, or 0. So maybe the code can assume that platform is one of those values. But perhaps I should handle cases where platform is not recognized. However, the problem doesn't mention that, so maybe just proceed.

But let me test with examples.

If the input is "a/b/c" and platform is 0 (Windows), then splitting on backslash would give ["a/b/c"], since there are no backslashes. But if the input is "a\b\c", then splitting on backslash would give ['a', 'b', 'c'].

Wait, but the function is supposed to split the input string according to the platform's style. So perhaps the function is intended to split paths, but the user might pass any string. So the function will split the string using the platform's delimiter, regardless of whether it's a path or not.

So the code would be as above. But need to make sure that the delimiter is correctly set.

Wait, but in Python, when you split a string with a delimiter, it splits on every occurrence. So for example, "a\\b\\c".split('\\') would split into ['a', 'b', 'c'] on Windows. But if the input string is using forward slashes, then on Windows, splitting with backslash would not split them, but perhaps the function is intended to split the string as per the platform's standard, regardless of the actual characters in the string.

But the problem says "split the input str under given platform". So maybe the function is meant to split the string using the platform's path separator. So the code is correct.

But wait, the function's name is split, which is the same as the built-in function. But the user might have intended to override it. However, the code is supposed to be generated as per the given function signature. So the code would be as written.

But perhaps the user wants to split the string into parts as per the platform's path splitting rules. So the code would split on the appropriate delimiter.

Another thing: the split method in Python splits on every occurrence of the delimiter. So for example, "a//b".split('/') would give ['a', '', 'b'].

But that's acceptable, as per the problem's description.

So the code would be:

import os

def split(s, platform='this'):
    """
    Split the input str under given platform, return the splitting result
    If platform equals 'this', auto-detect current platform.
    If platform equals 1, use POSIX style.
    If platform equals 0, use Windows/CMD style.
    Args:
        s: input str
        platform: 'this' = auto from current platform; 1 = POSIX; 0 = Windows/CMD
    Returns:
        a list of splitting str
    """
    if platform == 'this':
        delimiter = '/' if os.name == 'posix' else '\\'
    elif platform == 1:
        delimiter = '/'
    elif platform == 0:
        delimiter = '\\'
    else:
        # Maybe default to 'this'?
        # But the problem says platform is either 'this', 1, or 0. So perhaps no need.
        # However, to handle unexpected values, maybe set a default.
        # But according to the function signature, the default is 'this', so perhaps the else is not needed.
        # But for code robustness, maybe handle it. However, the problem doesn't mention it, so perhaps proceed as per the given options.
        # Let's assume that platform is one of the specified values.
        pass
    return s.split(delimiter)

Wait, but what if the platform is not 'this', 1, or 0? The code as written would not handle that. However, the problem says that the platform argument is either 'this', 1, or 0. So perhaps the code can assume that the input is valid. So the else case is not needed.

But the code as written would have an error if platform is not one of those. For example, if someone passes 2, then the code would not set delimiter. But the problem says the platform is 'this', 1, or 0. So maybe it's okay.

But the function's docstring says platform is 'this' or 1 or 0. So the code can proceed with those cases.

So the code would be:

import os

def split(s, platform='this'):
    """
    Split the input str under given platform, return the splitting result
    If platform equals 'this', auto-detect current platform.
    If platform equals 1, use POSIX style.
    If platform equals 0, use Windows/CMD style.
    Args:
        s: input str
        platform: 'this' = auto from current platform; 1 = POSIX; 0 = Windows/CMD
    Returns:
        a list of splitting str
    """
    if platform == 'this':
        delimiter = '/' if os.name == 'posix' else '\\'
    elif platform == 1:
        delimiter = '/'
    elif platform == 0:
        delimiter = '\\'
    return s.split(delimiter)

But wait, what about the case when platform is 'this' but os.name is something else? Like, maybe on a Windows machine, os.name is 'nt', so delimiter is set to backslash.

Yes, that's correct.

Testing this function: for example, if s is "home/user/file.txt" and platform is 0, then splitting on backslash would return the same string as a single element. But if the string is "C:\\user\\file.txt", then splitting on backslash would give ['C:', 'user', 'file.txt'].

But the function is supposed to split the input string according to the platform's style. So this seems correct.

Another thing: the split method in Python splits on every occurrence of the delimiter. So if the string has multiple delimiters in a row, it will include empty strings in the list. For example, "a//b".split('/') gives ['a', '', 'b'].

But the problem's docstring doesn't mention handling such cases, so the code should just split using the delimiter as is.

Therefore, the code should be as above. But need to make sure that the delimiter is correctly set for each platform.

Wait, but the problem says that if platform is 0, use Windows/CMD style. Does that mean that the splitting is done using the CMD's path separator, which is semicolon? Or is it the file system separator?

Wait, the function's name is split, and the description says splitting the input string under the given platform. So perhaps the splitting is based on the path separator of the platform. For example, in POSIX, the path separator is '/', and in Windows, it's '\'.

But in CMD, the path separator is ';' for environment variables, but for file paths, it's the backslash. So maybe the problem refers to the file system path separator. So the code is correct.

Therefore, the generated code is as written above.
