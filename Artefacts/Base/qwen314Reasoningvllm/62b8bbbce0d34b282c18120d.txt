Okay, I need to write a Python function called is_file_exist that checks if a given file name exists. Let me think about how to do this.

First, I remember that Python has a module called os which provides functions for interacting with the operating system. One of those functions is os.path.exists, which can check if a file or directory exists. But wait, the function is specifically for checking if it's a file, not a directory. Oh right, there's also os.path.isfile. So maybe I should use that to ensure it's a file and not a directory.

Wait, the docstring says "Check whether file_name is an existing file." So the function should return True if the file exists and is a regular file, not a directory. So using os.path.isfile would be more accurate than just exists, because exists would return True for directories too.

So the steps are: import os, then use os.path.isfile(file_name). But I need to make sure that the file_name is a string. Oh, but the function parameter is file_name, which is passed as an argument. The user is expected to pass a string, but maybe I should handle cases where it's not? The problem statement doesn't mention that, so perhaps it's assumed that file_name is a valid string.

So the code would be:

import os

def is_file_exist(file_name):
    """
    Check whether file_name is an existing file.
    """
    return os.path.isfile(file_name)

Wait, but sometimes people might use os.path.exists and then check if it's a file. However, using isfile directly is better because it checks both existence and that it's a file. So that's correct.

I should test this function. For example, if the file exists, it returns True. If not, False. Also, if the path is a directory, it returns False. That's right.

So the final code is importing os and returning os.path.isfile(file_name). That's straightforward. No need for any other error handling unless specified, which it isn't. So that's the code.
