Okay, I need to write a Python function called load_configurations that takes config_filenames, overrides, and resolve_env. The docstring says it should load and validate each config file, log errors if they occur, and return a tuple with the parsed configs and any error logs.

First, I'll start by importing necessary modules. The function needs to handle file reading, so I'll need os and maybe logging. Also, for parsing the config files, perhaps using ConfigParser from the configparser module. Oh, and the overrides parameter is a dict that can override values in the config files. Resolve_env is a boolean to determine if environment variables should be resolved.

Wait, the user didn't specify the format of the configuration files. But the function name suggests they might be INI files, given the use of ConfigParser. So I'll assume that. So I'll use ConfigParser to read each file.

Now, the function should process each filename in the sequence. For each file, I need to check if it exists and is readable. If not, log an error. Then parse it, applying overrides and resolving environment variables if needed.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Initialize a dictionary to hold the parsed configurations.
2. Initialize a list to collect any error log records.
3. Iterate over each config_filename in config_filenames.
4. For each file, check if it exists using os.path.exists. If not, create a log record about the missing file.
5. If the file exists, try to read it. Use ConfigParser's read method. But need to handle exceptions like PermissionError or configparser errors.
6. Apply overrides: maybe after reading, loop through the overrides and set them in the config.
7. If resolve_env is True, replace any values that are environment variables with their actual values. Like using os.getenv for each value.
8. For each error encountered, append a LogRecord to the errors list. But how to create LogRecord instances? The logging module's LogRecord is a class, but usually, you get them via logging.getLogger().handle() or similar. Wait, maybe the user expects us to create them manually? Or perhaps use the logging module to log the errors and capture them?

Hmm, the docstring says the errors will be recorded in the error log. But the function returns a sequence of logging.LogRecord instances. So maybe the function is supposed to generate these records without actually logging them, but collect them. That's a bit tricky because normally, LogRecord instances are created by the logging system when a log message is emitted. But perhaps the user wants us to simulate that by creating LogRecord objects manually.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to use the logging module to log the errors, and then collect those records. But how to capture them? That would require setting up a logger with a handler that stores the records. However, that might be beyond the scope here. The problem says to record the error log, so maybe we just create LogRecord instances for each error.

Wait, the LogRecord is part of the logging module. To create one, you need to specify the name, level, message, etc. But perhaps the user expects that the errors are logged using the standard logging mechanism, and then we collect those records. However, without a logger setup, that's not straightforward. Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to generate the LogRecord instances as part of the error handling.

Let me think. The function returns a tuple of (config_dict, error_logs). The error_logs are instances of logging.LogRecord. So I need to create those when errors occur.

But how? The LogRecord is usually created internally by the logging module. To create one manually, I can use logging.LogRecord, but that's not typical. Maybe the user is okay with creating a LogRecord with the necessary parameters. For example, when a file can't be read, create a LogRecord with the appropriate message and level.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to use the logging module to log the errors, and then somehow retrieve those records. But that would require a way to capture them, which isn't standard unless you have a custom handler.

This is a bit ambiguous, but given the function's docstring, I think the intention is to generate LogRecord instances for each error encountered during the loading process. So I'll proceed under that assumption.

So for each config file, I'll try to read it. If there's an error (like PermissionError, or a parsing error), I'll create a LogRecord with the error message and level=logging.ERROR.

But how to get the logger name? The docstring doesn't specify, so maybe the function uses the root logger. Alternatively, the LogRecord could be created with a default name, like 'config_loader'.

Wait, the LogRecord constructor requires several parameters: name, level, pathname, msg, args, exc_info, etc. But maybe the user just wants the message and level, and the rest can be default or filled with placeholders.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to use the logging module to log the errors, and then the error_logs list would contain those records. But in practice, that's not possible unless you have a way to capture them. However, perhaps the user is okay with creating LogRecord instances manually for the purpose of this function, even if they aren't actually logged. That might be the case here.

So, I'll proceed by creating LogRecord instances when errors occur. For example, when a file can't be read, create a LogRecord with the message indicating the problem.

Now, the code steps:

Import necessary modules: os, logging, configparser.

Initialize config_dict as empty dict.

Initialize errors as empty list.

For each filename in config_filenames:

   Check if the file exists. If not, create a LogRecord with message like "Configuration file not found: {filename}".

   Else, try to read the file using ConfigParser. Maybe use a try-except block.

   If reading fails (like PermissionError, or configparser errors), create a LogRecord with the error message.

   If reading is successful, apply overrides. For each key in overrides, set the value in the config. But need to check if the section exists. Or maybe the overrides are for the entire config, not per section? The docstring isn't clear. Let's assume that overrides is a dictionary where keys are (section, key) tuples, or maybe the overrides are applied to the config as a whole. Alternatively, perhaps the overrides are a dictionary that can override any key in the config, regardless of section. But that's unclear. Maybe the overrides are applied to the ConfigParser object, perhaps by using the read_string method with the overrides as a string, or by modifying the ConfigParser's values. Alternatively, maybe the overrides are a dict that can be merged into the config. For example, if the config has a section 'DEFAULT', then overrides could be merged into that. But this is unclear. The docstring says "overrides=None, resolve_env=True" but doesn't specify the structure. Maybe the overrides are a dictionary that can be used to override values in the config. For example, if a config has a key 'host' in a section, and overrides has 'host': 'newvalue', then that would replace it.

But how to apply the overrides. Let's think: after reading the config file, for each key in overrides, we can set it in the ConfigParser. However, ConfigParser requires sections. So perhaps the overrides are applied to the DEFAULT section, or to specific sections. Alternatively, maybe the overrides are a flat dictionary, and we need to apply them to the ConfigParser's sections. But this is ambiguous.

Alternatively, maybe the overrides are a dictionary of key-value pairs that are applied to the ConfigParser's values. For example, if the config has a key 'host' in a section, and overrides has 'host': 'newvalue', then that key is replaced. But how to handle sections? Maybe the overrides are for the DEFAULT section. Or perhaps the overrides are applied to all sections. This part is unclear, but perhaps the function is intended to allow overriding any key in the config. So, perhaps the overrides are a flat dictionary, and the code will iterate through all sections and keys in the ConfigParser, and if a key exists in overrides, replace it.

Alternatively, maybe the overrides are a dictionary where the keys are (section, key) tuples. But the docstring doesn't specify. Since the user hasn't given more details, perhaps the code should assume that overrides is a dictionary where keys are (section, key) tuples, and values are the new values. Or maybe the overrides are applied to the DEFAULT section. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the overrides are a flat dictionary, and the code applies them to the DEFAULT section. But that's an assumption. Since the user hasn't specified, perhaps I should proceed with a way that makes sense. For example, the overrides can be a dictionary of key-value pairs, and the code will go through each section and key in the ConfigParser and replace any keys present in overrides. But that's a bit involved.

Alternatively, maybe the overrides are a dictionary that is merged into the ConfigParser's sections. For example, if the config has a section 'database' with key 'host', and overrides has 'database.host' as a key, then set that value. But again, not sure.

This is a problem. Since the user hasn't specified, perhaps the code should apply the overrides to the ConfigParser's sections. For example, if overrides is a dictionary with keys like 'section.key', then split into section and key and set them. But that's a possible approach.

Alternatively, maybe the overrides are a dictionary that is used to update the ConfigParser's values. For example, for each key in overrides, set it in the DEFAULT section. But that's a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the overrides are a dictionary that can be passed to the ConfigParser's read_dict method. But that would require the overrides to be in a specific format.

This is a bit of a problem. Since the user hasn't specified, perhaps the code should assume that overrides is a dictionary where the keys are (section, key) tuples, and the values are the new values. But that's not the standard way. Alternatively, maybe the overrides are a flat dictionary, and the code applies them to the DEFAULT section. But that's not clear.

Alternatively, perhaps the overrides are a dictionary that is used to update the ConfigParser's values, regardless of the section. For example, if a key exists in any section, it's overridden. But that's not typical. Maybe the function is intended to allow overriding specific keys in the config, perhaps in the DEFAULT section.

Alternatively, maybe the overrides are applied to the ConfigParser's sections. For example, if the overrides are {'section1.key1': 'value1'}, then split into section and key and set accordingly.

But given that the user hasn't specified, perhaps the code should proceed with the following approach: after parsing the config file, for each key in overrides, set the value in the ConfigParser. But how to handle sections? Maybe the overrides are for the DEFAULT section. Or maybe the overrides are applied to all sections. Alternatively, perhaps the overrides are a flat dictionary, and the code applies them to the DEFAULT section. But this is unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the overrides are a dictionary that can be used to override any key in the config. For example, if the config has a key 'host' in a section, and overrides has 'host' as a key, then replace that value. But how to do that? Maybe the code loops through all sections and keys in the ConfigParser and replaces any keys present in overrides. However, that's a bit more complex.

Alternatively, maybe the overrides are applied to the ConfigParser's values, and the code uses the read_string method with the overrides as a string. But that's not straightforward.

This is a possible point of confusion. However, given the lack of details, perhaps the code should proceed with the assumption that overrides is a dictionary where each key is a (section, key) pair, and the value is the new value. For example, overrides could be {'section1.key1': 'value1', ...}.

But how to handle that. Let's think: for each key in overrides, split into section and key. Then, set that value in the ConfigParser.

Alternatively, perhaps the overrides are applied to the ConfigParser's sections. For example, if the overrides are a dictionary of section names to key-value pairs. But again, the user hasn't specified.

Alternatively, maybe the overrides are a flat dictionary, and the code applies them to the DEFAULT section. For example, if the config has a key 'host' in the DEFAULT section, and overrides has 'host': 'newhost', then that would replace it.

But since the user hasn't specified, perhaps I should proceed with a standard approach. Let's look for similar functions. For example, in some configuration loading utilities, overrides can be passed as a dictionary, and they are applied to the configuration after parsing. So perhaps the code would read the config, then for each key in overrides, set the value in the ConfigParser. However, ConfigParser requires sections. So maybe the overrides are for the DEFAULT section. Or maybe the code adds a new section for overrides. But again, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the overrides are applied to the ConfigParser's values, regardless of the section. For example, if the config has a key 'host' in any section, and overrides has 'host': 'newhost', then replace that. But that's not typical. Maybe the function is intended to allow overriding specific keys, perhaps in a specific section.

Alternatively, maybe the overrides are a dictionary that is merged into the ConfigParser's sections. For example, if the overrides are {'section1': {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}}, then that would be merged into the config. But again, the user hasn't specified.

This is a problem. Since the user hasn't provided details on how to apply the overrides, perhaps the code should proceed with the following approach: after reading the config, for each key in overrides, set it in the ConfigParser. But to do that, the code would need to know which section the key belongs to. If the overrides are for the DEFAULT section, then that's manageable. Otherwise, perhaps the code assumes that the overrides are for the DEFAULT section.

Alternatively, maybe the overrides are a flat dictionary, and the code applies them to the DEFAULT section. Let's proceed with that assumption for now.

So, the code would be:

import os
import logging
from configparser import ConfigParser, ParsingError

def load_configurations(config_filenames, overrides=None, resolve_env=True):
    config_dict = {}
    errors = []
    parser = ConfigParser()
    for filename in config_filenames:
        try:
            if not os.path.exists(filename):
                error_msg = f"Configuration file not found: {filename}"
                error_record = logging.LogRecord(name='config_loader', level=logging.ERROR, pathname=__file__, msg=error_msg, args=None, exc_info=None, func=None, lineno=0)
                errors.append(error_record)
                continue
            parser.read(filename)
            # Apply overrides
            if overrides:
                for key, value in overrides.items():
                    section, key = key.split('.', 1)
                    parser[section][key] = value
            # Resolve environment variables
            if resolve_env:
                for section in parser.sections():
                    for key in parser[section]:
                        if isinstance(parser[section][key], str) and parser[section][key].startswith('${') and parser[section][key].endswith('}'):
                            env_var = parser[section][key][2:-1]
                            parser[section][key] = os.environ.get(env_var, parser[section][key])
            config_dict[filename] = parser
        except (PermissionError, ParsingError) as e:
            error_msg = f"Error parsing {filename}: {str(e)}"
            error_record = logging.LogRecord(name='config_loader', level=logging.ERROR, pathname=__file__, msg=error_msg, args=None, exc_info=None, func=None, lineno=0)
            errors.append(error_record)
    return config_dict, errors

Wait, but the ConfigParser.read method reads multiple files. However, in the loop, for each filename, we are reading it into the same parser. That would merge all configs into one. But the docstring says "each configuration file" and returns a dict of filename to parsed configuration. So perhaps each filename is parsed into a separate ConfigParser instance. Because if we read all into one parser, then the config_dict would have the same parser for all files, which doesn't make sense. So the initial approach is wrong.

Ah, right! The function should load each configuration file separately. So for each filename, create a new ConfigParser instance. Then, process that.

So, inside the loop, for each filename:

Create a new ConfigParser.

Try to read the file. If it doesn't exist, log the error.

If it exists, read it, apply overrides, resolve env variables.

Then, store the parser in config_dict with the filename as the key.

So the code should be:

def load_configurations(config_filenames, overrides=None, resolve_env=True):
    config_dict = {}
    errors = []
    for filename in config_filenames:
        parser = ConfigParser()
        try:
            if not os.path.exists(filename):
                error_msg = f"Configuration file not found: {filename}"
                error_record = logging.LogRecord(...)
                errors.append(...)
                continue
            parser.read(filename)
            # Apply overrides
            if overrides:
                for key, value in overrides.items():
                    section, key = key.split('.', 1)
                    parser[section][key] = value
            # Resolve environment variables
            if resolve_env:
                for section in parser.sections():
                    for key in parser[section]:
                        if isinstance(parser[section][key], str) and parser[section][key].startswith('${') and parser[section][key].endswith('}'):
                            env_var = parser[section][key][2:-1]
                            parser[section][key] = os.environ.get(env_var, parser[section][key])
            config_dict[filename] = parser
        except (PermissionError, ParsingError) as e:
            error_msg = f"Error parsing {filename}: {str(e)}"
            error_record = logging.LogRecord(...)
            errors.append(...)
    return config_dict, errors

But wait, the overrides might be a flat dictionary. For example, if the overrides are {'host': 'localhost'}, then splitting on '.' would give section as 'host' and key as empty, which is not correct. So perhaps the overrides are structured as a dictionary where each key is a (section, key) pair. But that's not clear. Alternatively, maybe the overrides are a dictionary where the keys are in the format 'section.key', and the code splits on '.' to get the section and key. That would make sense.

So, for example, if overrides is {'database.host': 'localhost'}, then split into 'database' and 'host', then set parser['database']['host'] = 'localhost'.

But in that case, the code would need to split the key into section and key. However, if the key doesn't have a '.', then it would raise an error. So perhaps the code should handle that, but the user hasn't specified. Maybe the overrides are structured as a flat dictionary, and the code applies them to the DEFAULT section. Or perhaps the overrides are applied to all sections, but that's unclear.

This is a problem. Since the user hasn't provided details, perhaps the overrides are a flat dictionary, and the code applies them to the DEFAULT section. So, for each key in overrides, set it in the DEFAULT section. But that's an assumption.

Alternatively, maybe the overrides are a dictionary of section names to key-value pairs. For example, overrides could be {'section1': {'key1': 'value1', ...}, ...}.

But again, the user hasn't specified. So perhaps the code should proceed with the assumption that overrides is a flat dictionary where keys are in the format 'section.key', and split them accordingly.

But how to handle if the key doesn't have a '.'? Maybe the code assumes that the key is in the DEFAULT section. For example, if the key is 'host', then set parser['DEFAULT']['host'] = value. But that's a possible approach.

Alternatively, maybe the overrides are applied to all sections, but that's not clear.

This is a bit of a problem. However, given the ambiguity, perhaps the code should proceed with the following logic: when applying overrides, if the key is in the format 'section.key', split into section and key, and set that value. Otherwise, perhaps assume it's for the DEFAULT section. But that's not foolproof. However, the user hasn't provided more details, so I'll proceed with that approach, even if it's a bit hacky.

Another thing: the resolve_env parameter. The docstring says to resolve environment variables. So, for each value in the config, if it starts with ${ and ends with }, replace it with the environment variable's value. But how to do that. For example, in ConfigParser, the values are strings, so perhaps the code checks if a value is in that format and replaces it.

But the code above does that by checking if the value starts with '${' and ends with '}'. However, that's a simplistic approach. Maybe the code should use the os.getenv function, but that's what the code does.

So, the code for resolve_env would loop through all sections and keys, and for each value, check if it's in the form of an environment variable reference, and replace it.

But the code as written would overwrite the value in the ConfigParser. However, ConfigParser's values are stored as strings, so that's okay.

Now, the error handling. The function should catch any errors that occur during reading the file. For example, if the file can't be read due to permissions, or parsing errors. So, the try-except block would catch PermissionError and ParsingError.

But in Python, ConfigParser's read method can raise ParsingError if there's an error in the file. Also, if the file can't be opened, perhaps it raises a FileNotFoundError. But the code checks for os.path.exists first. However, even if the file exists, it might not be readable due to permissions. So, the code checks for existence, then tries to read. But the read method may still fail for other reasons, like not being a valid config file.

Wait, the os.path.exists check is not sufficient to determine if the file can be read. For example, the file might exist but not be readable. So, the code should attempt to read the file, and catch exceptions that occur during reading. However, the initial check for existence is perhaps to log a specific error message for missing files, rather than a generic one.

But perhaps the code should not check for existence first, but let the read method raise exceptions. However, the docstring says that if the file can't be read due to insufficient permissions, the error is logged. So, perhaps the code should check for existence, and then try to read, but also catch exceptions during reading.

Alternatively, the code can try to read the file, and if it raises a FileNotFoundError, then log that. For PermissionError, log that. For ParsingError, log that.

But in that case, the code can be simplified by removing the os.path.exists check and handling the exceptions. However, the docstring says that if the file cannot be read due to insufficient permissions or parsing errors, the error is logged. So, perhaps the code should attempt to read the file, and catch exceptions like PermissionError, ParsingError, and FileNotFoundError.

But in Python, ConfigParser's read method will raise a FileNotFoundError if the file doesn't exist. So, perhaps the code can just try to read the file, and catch those exceptions. However, the user might want to differentiate between missing files and other errors. For example, the error message for missing file is different from permission error or parsing error.

But the original code had a check for os.path.exists. However, that check might not be necessary if the read method will raise the appropriate error. But the user's docstring says that the error log will be recorded if the file can't be read due to permissions or parsing. So perhaps the code should not check for existence, but let the read method handle it. However, the code may need to handle FileNotFoundError as well.

But the original code's docstring says that the error log is recorded if the file can't be read due to insufficient permissions or parsing errors. So, perhaps the code should handle PermissionError and ParsingError, but not FileNotFoundError. Wait, but FileNotFoundError is a type of error that prevents reading the file. So maybe the code should handle that as well.

This is getting complicated. Let me think again.

The function needs to handle cases where the file can't be read (insufficient permissions) or parsing errors. So, the code should catch exceptions that occur during reading the file. For example, trying to read a file that doesn't exist would raise FileNotFoundError, which is a type of error that prevents reading. So, perhaps the code should catch that.

But how to differentiate between the different error types. For example, in the try block, when we call parser.read(filename), it may raise various exceptions. So, perhaps the code should catch exceptions like PermissionError, ParsingError, and FileNotFoundError.

But in Python, the ConfigParser.read method doesn't raise a FileNotFoundError. It returns the number of files successfully read. If the file doesn't exist, it's silently ignored. Wait, no. Let me check: ConfigParser.read() will attempt to open the file. If the file doesn't exist, it will raise a FileNotFoundError. Or does it? Wait, no. The ConfigParser's read method will try to open the file. If the file doesn't exist, then it will raise a FileNotFoundError. So, in that case, the code needs to handle that exception.

But in the original code, the user checks for os.path.exists first. However, that's redundant because if the file doesn't exist, the read method will raise an error. But perhaps the user wants to log a specific message for missing files. So, the code can check for existence first, and log that as an error, then proceed to read the file, but that's not necessary because the read would fail anyway.

But the user's docstring says that if the file can't be read due to insufficient permissions or parsing errors, then the error is logged. So, perhaps the code should not check for existence, but let the read method handle it, and catch the exceptions. However, the user might want to log the missing file as an error. So, perhaps the code should handle FileNotFoundError as well.

So, the code can be:

for filename in config_filenames:
    parser = ConfigParser()
    try:
        parser.read(filename)
        # process
    except (FileNotFoundError, PermissionError, ParsingError) as e:
        # create error log record

But then, how to differentiate between the types of errors. However, the docstring says that if the file can't be read due to insufficient permissions or parsing errors, log the error. So, perhaps the code should handle those exceptions. But FileNotFoundError is also a case where the file can't be read. So, perhaps the code should handle that as well.

So, the code would have:

try:
    parser.read(filename)
except (FileNotFoundError, PermissionError, ParsingError) as e:
    # log error

But in Python, the ConfigParser.read() method doesn't raise a FileNotFoundError. Let me check. If you call ConfigParser.read('nonexistent.ini'), it will try to open the file. If it can't find it, it raises a FileNotFoundError. So yes, that's correct.

So, the code can be written as:

import os
import logging
from configparser import ConfigParser, ParsingError

def load_configurations(config_filenames, overrides=None, resolve_env=True):
    config_dict = {}
    errors = []
    for filename in config_filenames:
        parser = ConfigParser()
        try:
            parser.read(filename)
            # Apply overrides
            if overrides:
                for key, value in overrides.items():
                    # Assuming key is in 'section.key' format
                    try:
                        section, key = key.split('.', 1)
                    except ValueError:
                        # No dot in the key, maybe assume DEFAULT section
                        section = 'DEFAULT'
                        key = key
                    parser[section][key] = value
            # Resolve environment variables
            if resolve_env:
                for section in parser.sections():
                    for key in parser[section]:
                        value = parser[section][key]
                        if isinstance(value, str) and value.startswith('${') and value.endswith('}'):
                            env_var = value[2:-1]
                            env_value = os.environ.get(env_var)
                            if env_value is not None:
                                parser[section][key] = env_value
            config_dict[filename] = parser
        except (FileNotFoundError, PermissionError, ParsingError) as e:
            error_msg = f"Error reading or parsing {filename}: {str(e)}"
            error_record = logging.LogRecord(
                name='config_loader',
                level=logging.ERROR,
                pathname=__file__,
                msg=error_msg,
                args=None,
                exc_info=(type(e), e, e.__traceback__),
                func=__name__,
                lineno=0
            )
            errors.append(error_record)
    return config_dict, errors

Wait, but the LogRecord requires more parameters. The __file__ is the current file, but maybe the user wants the filename. Also, the exc_info is a tuple of (type, value, traceback). However, in the except block, e is the exception instance, so exc_info can be set to (type(e), e, e.__traceback__). But in practice, creating a LogRecord manually is not standard. However, the user's docstring says to return LogRecord instances, so perhaps that's acceptable.

Another thing: the overrides might not be in the format 'section.key'. So, the code splits on '.' and if that's not possible, it assumes the DEFAULT section. But this is a possible assumption.

But the user hasn't specified the structure of overrides. So, perhaps the overrides are a dictionary where each key is a (section, key) tuple. But that would require the keys to be tuples. However, the code as written splits on '.' which is a way to handle keys in the format 'section.key'.

Alternatively, maybe the overrides are a flat dictionary, and the code applies them to the DEFAULT section. But again, this is an assumption.

Given that the user hasn't provided more details, I think this approach is acceptable, even if it's not perfect.

Another point: the resolve_env part. The code checks if the value is a string that starts with ${ and ends with }, then replaces it with the environment variable. But in ConfigParser, values are stored as strings. So, that's okay.

But what if the value is something like ${VAR} where VAR is an environment variable? The code would replace that with the value of VAR. However, this is a simplistic approach. For example, it doesn't handle nested variables or other formats. But again, the user hasn't specified, so this is acceptable.

Putting it all together, the code would:

- For each filename, create a ConfigParser.
- Try to read the file, catching exceptions.
- Apply overrides, assuming keys are in 'section.key' format.
- Resolve environment variables if needed.
- Collect any errors as LogRecord instances.

But there's a problem with the LogRecord creation. The LogRecord constructor requires several parameters. The example code above uses __file__ as the pathname, which is the current script's file. But in reality, the pathname should be the filename that caused the error. Also, the exc_info is set with the exception's traceback. However, when creating a LogRecord manually, it's possible that some parameters are not filled in correctly. But given the user's requirement, this is the best approach I can think of.

Another thing: the code is supposed to return a dict of configuration filename to corresponding parsed configuration. So, each filename maps to a ConfigParser instance. But the ConfigParser instance is a mutable object, so when you modify it (like applying overrides), it affects the stored value. That's okay.

But the code as written applies overrides to each parser. However, if the overrides are for the same section and key across multiple files, that's handled.

So, this code should fulfill the requirements, even if some parts are based on assumptions.
