Okay, I need to write a Python function called gaussian that takes an input x and returns the value of a Gaussian function centered at u=0.2 with sigma=0.1. Let me think about the formula for a Gaussian distribution. The standard formula is (1/(sigma * sqrt(2*pi))) * exp(- (x - u)^2 / (2*sigma^2)). 

So, the parameters here are u=0.2 and sigma=0.1. I should make sure to plug those values into the formula. Let me check if I need to import any modules. Oh right, math is needed for exp, sqrt, and pi. 

Wait, the function signature is given as def gaussian(x):, so the input is a single variable x. The function should compute the Gaussian value for that x. Let me structure the code step by step.

First, import math. Then, define the function. Inside the function, calculate the exponent part: -(x - 0.2)**2 / (2 * (0.1)**2). Then compute the coefficient: 1 / (0.1 * math.sqrt(2 * math.pi)). Multiply the coefficient by the exponential of the exponent part. 

Let me make sure I have the formula right. The denominator in the exponent is 2*sigma squared. Yes. And the coefficient is 1 over sigma times sqrt(2pi). That's correct. 

So putting it all together, the code would be:

import math

def gaussian(x):
    u = 0.2
    sigma = 0.1
    coefficient = 1 / (sigma * math.sqrt(2 * math.pi))
    exponent = - (x - u)**2 / (2 * sigma**2)
    return coefficient * math.exp(exponent)

Wait, but maybe the user wants it to be more concise? Let me see. The docstring says "Calculate Gaussian centered with u is 0.2 and sigma is 0.1." So the parameters are fixed. The function doesn't take u or sigma as arguments, just x. So the code is correct as written. 

I should test if there are any possible errors. For example, if x is a list or array, but the function is written for a single value. Since the function's parameter is x, and the docstring doesn't mention handling arrays, I assume it's for a single float input. 

So the code should work. Let me make sure I didn't miss any parentheses or operator precedence. The exponent is calculated correctly with the parentheses around (x - u) and the division by 2*sigma squared. Yes. The coefficient uses sigma correctly. 

I think that's all. The code is straightforward.
