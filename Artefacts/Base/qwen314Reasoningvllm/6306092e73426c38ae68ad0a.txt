Okay, I need to generate Python code for the validate_choices_args method based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me think about what this method should do.

The docstring says it checks if the value of the given args is one of the available choices. So, the method probably needs to verify that each argument in 'args' is present in a predefined list of choices. But wait, where are these choices coming from? The function signature doesn't mention them. Maybe the class has an attribute that holds the available choices, like self.choices?

Assuming that the class has a 'choices' attribute which is a list or a dictionary of valid options, the method should iterate through the arguments and check each one against these choices. However, the parameters aren't clear. The 'args' parameter is passed, but what's its structure? Is it a single value or a collection of values?

Looking at the function name, maybe 'args' is a list of arguments that need validation. For example, if the method is part of a form or a configuration class, each argument in 'args' should be a key in the choices, and the value should be one of the allowed options.

Wait, the docstring says "value of the given args", which might imply that 'args' is a single argument. But the parameter is named 'args', which is often used for multiple arguments. Hmm, maybe the method is intended to validate multiple arguments, each of which should be in the choices.

Alternatively, perhaps 'args' is a dictionary, and each value in the dictionary needs to be checked against the choices. But the original function signature doesn't specify the type of 'args'. The user might have intended 'args' to be a list of values, or maybe a dictionary with keys corresponding to choices.

Since the docstring is a bit vague, I'll make an assumption. Let's say that 'args' is a list of values, and each value must be present in self.choices. So the method should check if all elements in 'args' are in self.choices. If any is not, it should raise an error or return False.

Alternatively, maybe the method is part of a class that has a specific set of choices for each argument. For example, if the class has a 'choices' dictionary where each key is an argument name and the value is a list of allowed values. Then, the method would check each argument in 'args' against its corresponding choices.

But the function signature only takes 'args' as a parameter. So perhaps the method is designed to validate that all elements in 'args' are in a predefined list. Let me think of a common scenario. For instance, in a command-line argument parser, you might have a list of allowed options, and this method checks if the provided arguments are among them.

Another possibility is that 'args' is a single value, and the method checks if that value is in self.choices. But the parameter name 'args' suggests multiple arguments. Maybe it's a tuple or a list.

Let me proceed with the assumption that 'args' is a list of values, and each value must be in self.choices. The method could return True if all are valid, False otherwise. Or raise a ValueError if any are invalid.

But the original docstring doesn't specify return types. The user might expect the method to raise an error if validation fails. So, the code would loop through each item in args and check if it's in self.choices. If any item is not found, raise an error.

Wait, but how is self.choices structured? If it's a list, then checking membership is straightforward. If it's a dictionary, maybe the keys are the allowed values. But without more context, it's hard to tell. Let's assume self.choices is a list.

So the code would be something like:

def validate_choices_args(self, args):
    for arg in args:
        if arg not in self.choices:
            raise ValueError(f"Invalid choice: {arg}")
    return True

But maybe the method is supposed to return a boolean instead of raising an error. The docstring doesn't specify, but the original code might have that intention. Alternatively, the user might want to collect all invalid arguments and report them.

Alternatively, if 'args' is a dictionary, and each value needs to be checked against the choices for that key. For example, if self.choices is a dictionary where each key maps to a list of allowed values. Then, the method would check each key in args and ensure the value is in the corresponding list.

But again, without knowing the structure of 'args' and 'self.choices', it's a bit ambiguous. However, given the function name and the parameter name, perhaps the method is intended to validate that all elements in 'args' are in the class's choices list.

I think the most straightforward approach is to check each element in 'args' against self.choices, which is a list. So the code would iterate through each item in args and check if it's present in self.choices. If any are missing, raise an error.

Another thing: the user might have intended to use the 'choices' attribute, so the code should reference self.choices. Also, the method is part of a class, so 'self' is correctly used.

So putting it all together, the code would look like:

def validate_choices_args(self, args):
    """
    Check if value of the given args is one of the available choices. \n:param args: The received arguments.
    """
    for arg in args:
        if arg not in self.choices:
            raise ValueError(f"Invalid argument value: {arg} is not in available choices.")
    return True

But maybe the method is supposed to return a list of invalid arguments or something else. However, the original docstring doesn't mention return values, so perhaps it's just validating and raising an error if any are invalid. The return True is optional, but maybe the method is meant to return whether all are valid.

Alternatively, if the method is part of a form validation, it might return a list of errors. But without more info, the simplest approach is to check each argument and raise an error if any are invalid. That way, the method enforces validation strictly.

I think that's a reasonable approach. Let me write the code accordingly.
