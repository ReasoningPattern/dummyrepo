Okay, I need to generate Python code for the _run_playbook function based on the given signature and docstring. Let me think about what this function is supposed to do.

The function takes cli_args, vars_dict, ir_workspace, and ir_plugin as parameters. The docstring says it runs ansible cli with the vars_dict as extra-vars. The return is ansible results. So the main task is to execute an Ansible playbook using the provided arguments and variables.

First, I remember that Ansible can be run via the command line using subprocess. But maybe there's a better way using the ansible module in Python. Wait, the user might be using Infrared, which is a tool for managing Ansible playbooks. Infrared's Workspace and Plugin objects probably have methods to handle this.

Looking at the parameters: cli_args is a list of command line arguments. vars_dict is the extra variables to pass. The ir_workspace and ir_plugin are objects from Infrared. I need to check how Infrared's API works here. Maybe the ir_plugin has a method to run playbooks, and the ir_workspace provides the necessary context like inventory or playbook paths.

The function needs to construct the Ansible command. Typically, you'd use something like ansible-playbook with the playbook file, inventory, extra-vars, etc. But since it's integrated with Infrared, perhaps the ir_workspace has a playbook directory or the plugin knows where the playbook is located.

Wait, the function's name is _run_playbook, which suggests it's an internal helper. So maybe it's using the Ansible CLI through subprocess. Let me think about how to structure that.

The cli_args would include things like the playbook name, inventory, etc. The vars_dict needs to be passed as extra-vars. In Ansible CLI, extra-vars can be passed with the -e or --extra-vars flag. So I need to convert the vars_dict into a string that can be used in the command line.

But how to handle the variables? If vars_dict is a dictionary, maybe we can use json.dumps to serialize it and then pass it as a JSON string. However, sometimes people use the format key=value pairs. But the Ansible CLI can take JSON for extra-vars if you use the --extra-vars flag with a JSON file, but that's more complex. Alternatively, using the -e flag with a string like "key1=value1 key2=value2".

Wait, the Ansible CLI allows passing variables as a string with spaces, but if the variables have complex structures, using JSON might be better. However, the user might expect that the vars_dict is passed as is. Maybe the function is supposed to use the Ansible API directly instead of the CLI, but the docstring mentions "ansible cli", so perhaps it's using the CLI.

So, using subprocess to run the ansible-playbook command. The cli_args would be the arguments passed to the function. But I need to include the necessary arguments like the playbook file, inventory, etc., which might be part of the ir_workspace or ir_plugin.

Alternatively, maybe the ir_plugin has a method that handles running playbooks. For example, in Infrared, plugins might have a run_playbook method that takes arguments and variables. But without knowing the exact API, I need to make assumptions.

Assuming that the ir_workspace provides the inventory and the playbook path. Let's say the playbook is in the workspace's playbooks directory. So the cli_args might include the playbook name, and the inventory is set via the workspace.

But the cli_args is a list of command line arguments. So perhaps the function is constructing the command line by combining cli_args with the necessary parameters. However, the user might have already included those in cli_args. Hmm.

Alternatively, the function could be using the AnsibleRunner from Infrared. Maybe the ir_plugin has a method to get the playbook path, and the ir_workspace provides the inventory.

Wait, the parameters are cli_args, vars_dict, ir_workspace, and ir_plugin. So maybe the cli_args are the arguments that the user would normally pass to ansible-playbook, like the playbook name, tags, etc. The vars_dict is the extra variables. The ir_workspace and ir_plugin are used to get the inventory or other context.

So the code would need to construct the command line arguments. Let me think about how to pass the extra variables. For example, if cli_args is something like ['playbook.yml', '--tags', 'tag1'], then we need to add the -e flag with the variables.

But how to format the vars_dict into the command line? If it's a simple dictionary, we can loop through the key-value pairs and add them as -e key=value. However, if the variables are nested, that might not work. But maybe the function is designed for simple variables.

Another approach: use the Ansible CLI via the subprocess module. The command would be something like ['ansible-playbook', 'playbook.yml', '-e', 'var1=value1 var2=value2', ...]. But the cli_args might already contain some of these arguments, so we need to merge them.

Wait, the cli_args is a list that the user provides. So maybe the function is supposed to take those arguments and add the extra-vars. But how to handle that? For example, if the user passes their own -e flags, we might need to avoid duplicating them. However, the docstring says that vars_dict is passed as Ansible extra-vars, so perhaps the function is responsible for adding those variables to the CLI arguments.

Alternatively, maybe the function is using the Ansible API directly. For example, using ansible.playbook.PlayBook and running it with the variables. But that would require more setup, like defining the playbook, inventory, etc.

But the docstring says "Runs ansible cli with vars dict", so it's probably using the CLI. So, the code would need to construct the command line with the necessary arguments, including the extra-vars from vars_dict.

Let me think about the structure. The function would need to call the Ansible CLI, passing the playbook, inventory, and extra-vars. The cli_args might include the playbook name, but maybe the ir_plugin has a default playbook. Alternatively, the cli_args could be the arguments that the user would pass, and the function is adding the extra-vars to them.

Wait, the parameters are cli_args, which is a list of command line arguments. So perhaps the function is meant to take those arguments and run them, adding the extra-vars. But how to integrate with Infrared's workspace and plugin?

Infrared's Workspace object might have a method to get the inventory path. For example, ir_workspace.inventory. Similarly, the plugin might have a playbook path. So maybe the code is something like:

Construct the command by combining the cli_args with the necessary parameters, such as the playbook path from the plugin, inventory from the workspace, and the extra-vars.

But without knowing the exact methods of ir_workspace and ir_plugin, I need to make some assumptions. Let's say that the playbook is determined by the plugin, and the inventory is from the workspace. Then, the code would construct the command line arguments accordingly.

Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a larger framework where the cli_args are already processed, and the vars_dict is added as extra variables. So perhaps using the AnsibleRunner from Infrared, which can take variables.

Wait, looking up Infrared's API (hypothetically), perhaps the ir_plugin has a method like run_playbook that takes variables. For example, the code might be:

return ir_plugin.run_playbook(cli_args, vars=vars_dict, workspace=ir_workspace)

But that's just a guess. However, the user's docstring says it's passing vars_dict as Ansible extra-vars, which suggests that the function is responsible for passing them to the CLI.

Another possibility is that the function is using the Ansible CLI via a subprocess, and the ir_workspace provides the inventory path. So the code would be:

command = ['ansible-playbook'] + cli_args + ['-e', json.dumps(vars_dict)]
result = subprocess.run(command, capture_output=True, text=True)
return result

But that's probably too simplistic. Also, the inventory might need to be specified. For example, if the ir_workspace has an inventory, then we need to add that to the command line.

Alternatively, the ir_workspace might have a method to get the inventory, and the ir_plugin has a playbook path. So:

playbook_path = ir_plugin.playbook_path
inventory = ir_workspace.inventory
command = ['ansible-playbook', playbook_path, '--inventory', inventory] + cli_args
# Then add the extra-vars
if vars_dict:
    command += ['-e', json.dumps(vars_dict)]
result = subprocess.run(command, ...)

But again, this is speculative. The exact implementation depends on how Infrared is structured. Since the user hasn't provided specific details, I need to make a reasonable assumption.

Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a class that has access to the necessary paths. But since the parameters include ir_workspace and ir_plugin, it's likely that those objects have the required information.

Another angle: the function is supposed to return the ansible results. So perhaps using the ansible_runner module, which is a Python library for running Ansible playbooks programmatically. In that case, the code could use ansible_runner.run with the necessary parameters.

But the docstring mentions "ansible cli", which might imply using the CLI rather than the API. However, using the API would be more straightforward for capturing results.

Wait, the user's function is named _run_playbook, which is an internal function. So perhaps they are using the Ansible CLI via subprocess, but integrating with Infrared's workspace and plugin.

Putting it all together, here's a possible approach:

- Use the ir_workspace to get the inventory path.
- Use the ir_plugin to get the playbook path.
- Combine cli_args with the necessary arguments, adding the inventory and playbook paths if not already present.
- Pass the vars_dict as extra-vars using the -e flag.
- Execute the command and return the results.

But since cli_args is provided, maybe the inventory and playbook are already included in cli_args. However, that might not be the case. So perhaps the function is supposed to use the ir_workspace and ir_plugin to determine the inventory and playbook paths, and then add the extra-vars.

Alternatively, maybe the cli_args is a list of arguments that the user would pass to the Ansible CLI, and the function is responsible for adding the extra-vars to that list.

So, the code could be:

import json
import subprocess

def _run_playbook(cli_args, vars_dict, ir_workspace, ir_plugin):
    # Construct the command line arguments
    cmd = ['ansible-playbook']
    # Add the playbook path from the plugin
    # Assuming ir_plugin has a method to get the playbook path
    playbook_path = ir_plugin.get_playbook_path()
    cmd.append(playbook_path)
    # Add inventory from workspace
    inventory_path = ir_workspace.inventory
    cmd.extend(['--inventory', inventory_path])
    # Add extra-vars
    if vars_dict:
        cmd.extend(['-e', json.dumps(vars_dict)])
    # Combine with cli_args
    cmd += cli_args
    # Run the command
    result = subprocess.run(cmd, capture_output=True, text=True)
    # Return the results
    return result.stdout, result.stderr, result.returncode

But this is making assumptions about methods like get_playbook_path() and inventory. However, the user's parameters include ir_workspace and ir_plugin, which are objects. So perhaps the actual code would use attributes or methods of those objects.

Alternatively, maybe the ir_workspace has a method to get the inventory, and the ir_plugin has a playbook name that's used. But without knowing the exact API, this is tricky.

Another possibility is that the function uses the AnsibleRunner from Infrared. For example:

from infrared import AnsibleRunner

def _run_playbook(cli_args, vars_dict, ir_workspace, ir_plugin):
    runner = AnsibleRunner(workspace=ir_workspace, plugin=ir_plugin)
    # Process cli_args into parameters
    # Then run with extra_vars
    result = runner.run(playbook=cli_args, extra_vars=vars_dict)
    return result

But again, this is speculative.

Given the ambiguity, perhaps the correct approach is to use the Ansible CLI via subprocess, assuming that the cli_args already contain the necessary parameters, and that the vars_dict is added as extra-vars. However, the function's parameters include ir_workspace and ir_plugin, which might be needed to construct the command.

Wait, maybe the cli_args is a list that includes the playbook name and other options, and the function is supposed to run that command with the extra-vars. For example, if cli_args is ['playbook.yml', '-i', 'inventory.ini', '--tags', 'tag1'], then the function would add the -e flag with the variables.

But how to handle the vars_dict? If it's a dictionary, converting it to a string with key=value pairs. However, if the variables are complex, using JSON might be better, but the CLI might not handle that unless specified with a file.

Alternatively, using the --extra-vars flag with a JSON string. For example:

extra_vars_str = ' '.join([f"{k}={v}" for k, v in vars_dict.items()])
cmd = ['ansible-playbook'] + cli_args + ['-e', extra_vars_str]

But this would only work for flat variables. If there are nested structures, this approach might not work.

Another approach is to use the Ansible API directly. For example, using ansible.playbook.PlayBook and passing the variables. But that requires more setup, like defining the inventory, connection parameters, etc.

Alternatively, using the ansible_runner module, which allows running playbooks programmatically. The code could be:

import ansible_runner

def _run_playbook(cli_args, vars_dict, ir_workspace, ir_plugin):
    # Assuming ir_workspace provides the inventory path
    inventory = ir_workspace.inventory
    # Assuming the playbook is determined by the plugin
    playbook = ir_plugin.playbook
    # Combine cli_args into the runner's parameters
    # Maybe cli_args are additional parameters to pass
    # But how to parse them? Maybe they are split into key-value pairs
    # Or perhaps they are command line arguments like --tags, etc.
    # This is unclear.
    # For example, if cli_args is ['--tags', 'tag1'], then we can pass them as extra_args
    # So the command would be something like:
    r = ansible_runner.run(
        playbook=playbook,
        inventory=inventory,
        extra_vars=vars_dict,
        **cli_args_to_kwargs(cli_args)
    )
    return r

But then I need to convert cli_args into keyword arguments for ansible_runner.run. That might not be straightforward.

Given the uncertainty, perhaps the best approach is to use the subprocess module, assuming that the cli_args already include the playbook and inventory, and that the vars_dict is added as extra-vars. However, the presence of ir_workspace and ir_plugin suggests that they are needed to construct the command.

Wait, maybe the cli_args is a list of arguments that the user would pass to the Ansible CLI, but the function is responsible for adding the extra-vars. For example, the user might pass ['--tags', 'tag1'], and the function adds the -e flag with the variables.

So the code would be:

import json
import subprocess

def _run_playbook(cli_args, vars_dict, ir_workspace, ir_plugin):
    # Assuming that the playbook is determined by the plugin
    playbook_path = ir_plugin.playbook_path
    # Assuming inventory is from the workspace
    inventory_path = ir_workspace.inventory
    # Construct the command
    cmd = ['ansible-playbook', playbook_path, '--inventory', inventory_path]
    # Add the cli_args
    cmd += cli_args
    # Add extra-vars
    if vars_dict:
        cmd.extend(['-e', json.dumps(vars_dict)])
    # Run the command
    result = subprocess.run(cmd, capture_output=True, text=True)
    # Return the results
    return {
        'stdout': result.stdout,
        'stderr': result.stderr,
        'returncode': result.returncode
    }

But this is assuming that the plugin has a playbook_path attribute and the workspace has an inventory attribute. If that's not the case, the code would fail.

Alternatively, maybe the ir_workspace has a method to get the inventory, and the ir_plugin has a method to get the playbook path. But without knowing the actual API, it's hard to tell.

Another possibility is that the function is using the Infrared's internal methods. For example, the ir_workspace might have a run_playbook method that takes the arguments and variables. But again, this is speculative.

Given the lack of specific information, perhaps the correct code is to use the AnsibleRunner from Infrared's API. For example:

from infrared import AnsibleRunner

def _run_playbook(cli_args, vars_dict, ir_workspace, ir_plugin):
    runner = AnsibleRunner(workspace=ir_workspace, plugin=ir_plugin)
    # Parse cli_args into parameters
    # Assuming cli_args is a list of arguments to pass to the runner
    # For example, if cli_args contains --tags, etc.
    # But how to handle that? Maybe the runner's run method accepts a list of args
    # Or perhaps the cli_args are merged into the runner's parameters
    # This is unclear, but perhaps the function is supposed to run the playbook with the given args and variables
    result = runner.run(extra_vars=vars_dict, **cli_args)
    return result

But this is not syntactically correct. The **cli_args would require that cli_args is a dictionary of keyword arguments, but it's a list.

Hmm. Maybe the function is part of a class that has access to the necessary paths, and the cli_args are additional parameters. However, the parameters given are cli_args (list), vars_dict (dict), and the two Infrared objects.

Alternatively, the function is using the Infrared plugin's methods to run the playbook. For example, the ir_plugin might have a method like run_playbook that takes cli_args and vars_dict.

But since I don't have access to the actual Infrared API, I need to make a best guess. Perhaps the function is supposed to use the Ansible CLI, with the inventory and playbook determined by the Infrared objects, and the cli_args as additional parameters.

So, combining all that, the code would look something like this:

import json
import subprocess

def _run_playbook(cli_args, vars_dict, ir_workspace, ir_plugin):
    # Get playbook path from plugin
    playbook_path = ir_plugin.get_playbook_path()
    # Get inventory from workspace
    inventory_path = ir_workspace.inventory
    # Construct the command
    cmd = ['ansible-playbook', playbook_path, '--inventory', inventory_path]
    # Add extra variables
    if vars_dict:
        cmd.extend(['-e', json.dumps(vars_dict)])
    # Add cli_args
    cmd += cli_args
    # Execute the command
    result = subprocess.run(cmd, capture_output=True, text=True)
    # Return the results
    return {
        'stdout': result.stdout,
        'stderr': result.stderr,
        'returncode': result.returncode
    }

But again, this is assuming methods like get_playbook_path() and inventory. Maybe the actual code uses different attributes or methods.

Alternatively, perhaps the ir_workspace has a method to get the inventory, and the ir_plugin has a playbook name. For example:

inventory = ir_workspace.get_inventory()
playbook = ir_plugin.get_playbook()

But without knowing the exact method names, this is tricky.

Another approach: look for similar code in Infrared's source code. But since I can't do that, I need to proceed with assumptions.

In conclusion, the code is likely using the Ansible CLI via subprocess, combining the cli_args with the necessary parameters from the Infrared objects and the vars_dict as extra-vars. The exact implementation would depend on how the Infrared objects provide the playbook and inventory paths.
